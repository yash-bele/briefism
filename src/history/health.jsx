          The COVID-19 sub-variant JN.1 has now spread to 15 states and Union
          territories across India, with data from the Indian SARS-CoV-2
          Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) recording a total of 923 JN.1 cases
          detected in the country so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karnataka has reported the highest number of JN.1 infections at 214
          cases, followed by Maharashtra with 170 cases, Kerala at 154 cases,
          Andhra Pradesh at 105 cases, Gujarat at 76 cases, and Goa at 66 cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other states like Telangana and Rajasthan have seen 32 JN.1 cases
          each, Chhattisgarh has reported 25 cases, Tamil Nadu 22 cases, Delhi
          16 cases, Haryana 5 cases, Odisha 3 cases, West Bengal 2 cases, and
          Uttarakhand 1 case, as per the INSACOG data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the number of JN.1 cases is steadily rising across
          multiple states and the sub-variant has clearly gained a foothold in
          the country, health officials say there is no immediate cause for
          major concern yet. This is because the majority of those infected with
          JN.1 so far have experienced relatively mild illness and have been
          successfully isolating and recovering at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Centre has still asked all states and Union territories
          to maintain constant vigilance and surveillance amid the recent uptick
          in overall COVID-19 cases nationwide as well as the spread of the JN.1
          sub-variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, states have been urged to ensure effective compliance
          with the detailed operational guidelines for the revised COVID-19
          surveillance strategy that was shared with them by the Union Health
          Ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authorities have also advised states to regularly monitor and closely
          track the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute
          respiratory illness (SARI) cases being reported from all health
          facilities in each district. This is critical to allow for early
          detection of any rising trend of infections.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated JN.1 as a
          separate &quot;variant of interest&quot; due to its rapidly increasing
          transmission, it has assessed that JN.1 poses a &quot;low&quot; risk
          to global public health at the current time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to being classified as a distinct variant of interest, JN.1 was
          categorized under the BA.2.86 sub-lineages, which itself is the parent
          lineage that the WHO has designated an overall variant of interest.

        <p>
          A deficiency of vitamin A arises from the body not getting enough of
          this vital nutrient. People in developing nations are mainly affected
          by it, particularly in regions where malnutrition is common. Common
          causes include eating a diet low in foods high in vitamin A, having
          digestive issues that impair vitamin A absorption, and having certain
          medical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lack of vitamin A can result in a variety of illnesses and
          disabilities, especially those that affect the eyes. Continue reading

            </li>
            <li>
              Include leafy greens in your diet, such as kale, collard greens,
              and spinach, as they are rich in beta-carotene, which the body
              uses to make vitamin A.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add fruits that are high in beta-carotene and can help raise your
              vitamin A levels, like oranges, mangoes, and apricots.
            </li>
            <li>
              To help you reach your daily requirements, look for fortified
              cereals, milk, and other food products that are enhanced with
              vitamin A.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider taking a vitamin A supplement under a doctor&apos;s
              supervision if your diet isn&apos;t enough to meet your needs for
              the vitamin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat has the potential to destroy vitamin A, so use caution when
              cooking food to preserve its vitamin A content. Vegetables can
              have their nutrients preserved by lightly steaming or
              stirring-frying them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit or stay away from alcohol completely as it can cause
              problems with the absorption and utilisation of vitamin A.
            </li>
            <li>
              It has been demonstrated that smoking lowers vitamin A levels, so
              giving up can help you keep your body&apos;s vitamin A levels at
              their ideal levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Certain medications, like some acne treatments, can obstruct the
              body&apos;s ability to absorb and use vitamin A. Talk to your
              doctor about any possible medication-induced vitamin A deficiency.

          Few foods are as well-known in the world of healthful nutrition as
          oats, which provide a flexible and nourishing supplement to our
          regular diets. Beyond being a breakfast mainstay, oats have become
          well-known for their remarkable health advantages, making them a
          popular option for anyone looking for a nutrient-dense, heart-healthy
          meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oats have many benefits, ranging from supporting heart health to
          helping with weight management, which makes them an important part of
          a healthy, well-balanced diet. We learned about the nutritional
          benefits of oats from Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, a general practitioner and
          the founder and director of the Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals.

            <li>
              Heart health: Beta-glucans, a soluble fiber type found in oats,
              have the ability to lower cholesterol and thus support heart
              health.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blood sugar control: Oats are a good option for people with
              diabetes since their soluble fiber helps control blood sugar
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Digestion: The high fiber content of oats promotes a healthy
              digestive system and helps ease constipation. Additionally, it
              encourages fullness, which helps with weight management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Weight management: Oats&apos; high fiber content, which helps
              regulate appetite, can aid in weight loss and management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Absorption of nutrients: Oats are a good source of vitamins,
              minerals, and B-vitamins, which are important for the metabolism
              of energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Antioxidants: Avenanthramides, an antioxidant found in oats, have

        Scientists are learning about the long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2
        virus on mental health amidst its ongoing global impact. There may be a
        link between Covid-19 and mental health problems, according to recent
        research.
        <br />
        <br />
        Researchers have discovered a connection between severe Covid-19
        infection and schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, in a recent study.
        <br />
        <br />
        The results show that individuals with Covid-19 infection have a
        diagnosis of schizophrenia that is more than four times higher than that
        of those without the infection.
        <br />
        <br />
        Researchers from West Virginia University in the US have published in
        the National Library of Medicine about a possible interaction between
        vaccines and clozapine, a common medication used to treat schizophrenia.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the cause of schizophrenia, a mental illness characterized by
        hallucinations and cognitive impairments, is unknown, earlier research
        has hypothesized that viral infections may be involved. This theory is
        strengthened by the latest discovery, which demands more research.
        <br />
        <br />
        The study also made clear how important it is to carefully consider
        immunization plans for patients receiving clozapine therapy.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;According to our data, younger people who have Covid-19 are more
        likely to develop SSPD (Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders).
        These findings highlight the necessity of careful mental evaluation and
        assistance in the Long-Covid era, particularly for younger populations,
        and are consistent with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and past
        research&quot;, the authors wrote.
        <br />
        <br />
        The correlation observed between severe Covid-19 infections and a
        heightened likelihood of developing schizophrenia underscored the
        pressing requirement for an all-encompassing strategy to tackle the
        pandemic&apos;s enduring impact on mental health.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, the study examined how the pandemic affected primary care
        providers&apos; ability to provide Brief Interventions (BIs) for alcohol
        and tobacco use.

            The microbiota of the gut and the process of aging
          </span>
          <span>
            Numerous aspects of human health depend on the gut microbiota, which
            is composed of a diverse range of microorganisms such as bacteria,
            viruses, and fungi. It has a major impact on our immune system in
            addition to aiding in digestion and nutritional absorption. Our gut
            microbiota&apos;s makeup can change with age and is constantly
            evolving. Numerous factors, including food habits, drug use, and
            lifestyle decisions, can have an impact on these changes.
            Disproportion of beneficial to harmful microorganisms can lead to
            dysbiosis, a condition caused by an imbalance in the gut microbiota.
            In reality, unhealthful aging contributes to the continued growth of
            infections including Fusobacteria, Streptococcus, Eggerthella, and
            others.

          <span>
            As we grow older, it&apos;s important to manage body swelling, or
            &quot;inflammaging.&quot; Our stomach bacteria, along with genes,
            plays a role. We can care for our stomach bacteria by changing our
            lifestyle, understanding it better, and making healthy food choices.
            This may lower the risk of age-related diseases and support a
            healthier old age.

            National Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination Mission

          <span>
            The Prime Minister launched the National Sickle Cell Anemia
            Elimination Mission on July 1, 2023, in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh.
            This program is working intensely to find, prevent, and manage
            sickle cell anemia in areas with many tribal and high-risk
            populations across different states and union territories in India.
          </span>
          <span>
            India has 67.8 million tribal people, making up 8.6% of the
            population, according to the 2011 Census.
          </span>
          <span>
            The mission focuses on 278 districts in 17 states with higher rates
            of sickle cell disease. These states include Gujarat, Maharashtra,
            Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal,
            Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Assam,
            Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar, and Uttarakhand.

          <span className="text-xl block">Sickle cell disease (SCD)</span>
          <span>
            Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood problem found more
            often in tribal communities in India, but it can affect non-tribal
            people too. It happens when someone inherits two unusual genes, one
            from each parent, causing the creation of abnormal hemoglobin called
            hemoglobin S (HbS). Sometimes, HbS makes red blood cells stiff and
            shaped like crescent moons, which can block blood flow and cause
            pain and tissue damage.
          </span>
          <span>
            SCD also leads to anemia and reduces the ability to carry oxygen in
            the body. Symptoms include ongoing pain, anemia, vulnerability to
            infections, and harm to organs. Although there&apos;s no cure,
            treatments like blood transfusions and medication can help manage
            symptoms. In some cases, bone marrow or stem cell transplants may be
            considered. Early detection, regular medical care, and a healthy
            lifestyle can significantly improve the life quality of those with
            sickle cell disease.

        To keep your eyes healthy, health experts suggest eating specific foods
        and doing healthy things to take care of your eyes and your overall
        well-being.
        <br />
        <br />
        Eat lots of fruits and vegetables for good eye health. Leafy greens like
        kale and spinach have vitamins that help your eyes, and fatty fish like
        salmon can prevent dry eyes. Fruits such as kiwis, oranges, and berries
        protect your eyes by reducing stress. Citrus fruits have vitamin C,
        which is good for your eye blood vessels. Eating a variety of colorful
        fruits and veggies is the best way to get all the nutrients your eyes
        need.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maintaining an optimal balance of micronutrients such as zinc and
        vitamin E is crucial. Almonds and sunflower seeds, among other nuts and
        seeds, are excellent sources of vitamin E and can help ward off
        age-related vision issues. In order to maintain the health of your body
        and eyes, don&apos;t forget to drink adequate water. Take breaks and
        observe the 20-20-20 rule, which states that you should look at
        something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes, if you spend a
        lot of time staring at screens. This may lessen eye fatigue. In order to
        shield your eyes from the sun&apos;s damaging rays, which can result in
        conditions like cataracts, remember to wear sunglasses outside.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maintain good habits and eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods to keep
        your eyes healthy. Eating a varied diet rich in fruits, vegetables,
        berries, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes is good for your eyes in
        particular and your general health. Omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods like
        walnuts, flaxseeds, and fatty fish are beneficial for the structural
        integrity of your eyes. For optimal vision and general eye health,
        include foods high in vitamins A and C, such as eggs and dairy, and
        foods high in vitamins C and E, such as citrus fruits, bell peppers, and
        nuts. To prevent dry eyes, make sure you drink enough water. To lessen
        inflammation, limit your intake of processed foods and sugars.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wear sunglasses in the sun to protect your eyes from harmful rays. Use
        the 20-20-20 rule if you spend a lot of time on smart devices: every 20
        minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. This
        lessens the strain on the eyes. Additionally, schedule routine eye exams
        to detect any issues early. To keep your blood pressure and blood sugar
        under control, heed your doctor&apos;s advice if you have high blood
        pressure or diabetes. Neglecting these preventative steps may have
        detrimental effects on your eyes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Eat well, stay hydrated, and engage in healthy activities to maintain
        the health of your eyes. Shield your eyes from environmental factors and
        stress. Seeking individualized guidance from an eye care specialist is a
        smart move.
