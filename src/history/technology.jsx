          Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder, Bill Gates,
          recently made a significant visit to the Microsoft India Development
          Center (IDC), a pioneering innovation hub he conceptualized back in
          1988. Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, IDC, situated in
          Hyderabad, Telangana, stands as a cornerstone for the development of
          cutting-edge technologies, including Azure, Windows, Office, Bing,
          Copilot, and various AI applications.

        <p>
          During his visit, Gates engaged with some of India&apos;s brightest
          engineering talents at IDC, acknowledging them as a vital asset.
          Expressing optimism about India&apos;s potential as an AI-powered

          for spearheading innovation within Microsoft, spanning AI, cloud
          computing, security, and gaming realms, as articulated by Rajiv Kumar,
          Managing Director of Microsoft IDC and CVP of Experiences + Devices
          India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gates&apos; visit follows Microsoft&apos;s chairman and CEO, Satya
          Nadella&apos;s recent trip to India, where Nadella underscored the
          country&apos;s increasing importance in the realm of AI development
          and deployment. Nadella emphasized India&apos;s exceptional standing
          in terms of developer community size, predicting its eventual
          overtaking of the United States by 2027. This acknowledgment of
          India&apos;s vibrant developer ecosystem aligns with the overarching
          theme of democratizing AI to foster societal transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The essence of democratizing AI, championed by Gates and echoed by
          Nadella, resonates strongly with IDC&apos;s ongoing endeavors in
          pioneering AI research and development across various domains. While
          Gates has been a vocal proponent of the benefits of AI, he has also
          voiced concerns regarding its potential risks, often elaborating on
          these views through his widely read blog.

          In the contemporary smartphone market, uniformity in design and user
          interface prevails, offering little room for individuality or utility.
          However, HMD Global from Finland aims to disrupt this norm by
          introducing a novel concept termed Fusion, which promises both
          customization and practicality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam Ferguson, HMD&apos;s global head of insight, proposition, and
          product marketing, elucidates the company&apos;s strategy of
          empowering users to personalize their smartphones through the
          selection of diverse &quot;outfits.&quot; These outfits, akin to
          modular components, can be developed by anyone, from developers to
          ordinary consumers, thereby expanding the phone&apos;s functionality
          beyond conventional boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presented at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Fusion embodies a
          departure from the conventional notion of smartphones. It advocates
          for the integration of hardware and software to address real-world
          challenges, be it a barcode scanner, a medical device, or an extended
          battery. Ferguson emphasizes Fusion&apos;s objective of broadening the
          phone&apos;s utility beyond its existing capabilities, transcending
          mere aesthetic modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of outfits, as opposed to traditional modular
          designations, is facilitated by six pogo pins located on the
          phone&apos;s rear, enabling seamless attachment of accessories. This
          approach democratizes smartphone customization, inviting contributions
          from a diverse array of users, including hobbyists, educators, and
          professionals. Ferguson envisions Fusion as akin to the Raspberry Pi,
          a versatile tool that fosters innovation and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          HMD aims to support users in outfit creation, offering guidance and
          resources to facilitate both hardware and software development.
          Through an intuitive interface and simplified programming process, the
          company seeks to empower individuals and businesses to realize their
          innovative ideas. Additionally, HMD plans to establish a marketplace
          where users can access a wide range of outfits tailored to various
          needs and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first smartphone under the Fusion platform is slated for release
          in July, accompanied by a comprehensive developer toolkit to aid in
          outfit creation. While specifics regarding pricing and specifications
          remain undisclosed, Ferguson assures that outfits will be sold
          separately, ensuring affordability and accessibility for consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          While modular smartphones have been attempted by various companies in
          the past, HMD remains optimistic about Fusion&apos;s prospects. Unlike
          previous endeavors fraught with complexity and technical barriers,
          Fusion boasts a user-friendly approach that simplifies the
          customization process. Ferguson believes that Fusion has the potential
          to redefine the smartphone landscape, offering users unprecedented
          versatility and functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an industry grappling with stagnation, HMD&apos;s Fusion represents
          a refreshing approach to smartphone innovation. By prioritizing user
          empowerment and practical utility, the company aims to rejuvenate
          consumer interest and revitalize the smartphone market. With half of
          its global devices expected to be repairable, HMD emphasizes
          sustainability and longevity in its product offerings, catering to
          evolving consumer preferences.

          In a market characterized by uniformity, it&apos;s refreshing when a
          brand dares to innovate, as seen with the Redmi Buds 5. Boasting a
          sleek design and premium feel, these earbuds make a striking
          impression right out of the box. Available in matte white, mint, and
          black, the case exudes sophistication with its slim profile and
          easy-to-clean finish.

          Opening the case reveals thoughtful details, including an LED
          indicator for battery status and pairing notifications, along with
          soft cushioning that adds a satisfying touch. While the earbuds
          themselves may not match the case&apos;s elegance, their lightweight
          build and comfortable fit compensate for any perceived shortcomings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pairing the Buds 5 is seamless thanks to Google Fast Pair, ensuring
          quick and hassle-free connectivity with compatible devices. When it
          comes to audio quality, the 12.4mm drivers deliver a V-shaped
          frequency response, emphasizing bass and treble while maintaining
          natural sound reproduction. The earbuds also feature active noise
          cancellation (ANC) up to 46 decibels, effectively reducing ambient
          noise for an immersive listening experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a claimed total battery life of 40 hours, including ANC, the Buds
          5 offer respectable usage time on a single charge. However, touch
          controls can be a bit finicky, leading to inadvertent commands during
          adjustment. Despite this minor inconvenience, the Redmi Buds 5 excel
          in terms of design, sound quality, and overall value proposition,
          making them a standout choice in the budget segment.

        <p>
          Utilizing artificial intelligence technology, Truecaller offers live
          call transcription, allowing users to concentrate fully on the
          conversation without the need for note-taking. After the call
          concludes, Truecaller&apos;s AI automatically generates a
          transcription of the entire conversation along with a convenient
          summary.

        </p>
        <p>
          Android users can find a dedicated record button within
          Truecaller&apos;s dialer, enabling them to start or stop capturing
          phone meetings with a single tap. A floating button serves the same
          purpose for other dialers. Similar to iPhone users, Android users
          receive a notification when the call file is processed and ready for

        <p>
          Accessing this new functionality is straightforward, as it is part of
          Truecaller&apos;s Premium package, priced at Rs 75 per month or Rs 529
          annually. Subscribers not only gain access to call recording but also

          The spacecraft, known as the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon
          (SLIM), executed a precise touchdown on Jan. 20, marking Japan as the
          fifth nation to successfully deploy a probe on the moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, upon landing, the probe found itself inverted, hindering its
          solar panels&apos; ability to access sunlight initially, resulting in
          a shutdown within hours. SLIM regained power on the eighth day
          post-landing, upon exposure to sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over subsequent days, SLIM gathered geological data from lunar rocks
          before entering a hibernation period in late January to endure another
          lunar night.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAXA mentioned that Sunday&apos;s communication was brief as it was
          still &quot;lunar midday,&quot; with SLIM experiencing high
          temperatures of about 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit). The agency
          is preparing to re-establish contact once the vehicle has cooled down.
        </p>

          Scientists are eager to analyze moon rock mineral compositions to
          unravel clues about the moon&apos;s origins, comparing them with those

        <p>
          At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I had the opportunity to
          explore Lenovo&apos;s proof-of-concept ThinkBook laptop, featuring a
          transparent display akin to augmented reality. Interacting with the
          device evoked mixed emotions about its innovative positioning.

          Upon finally accessing the demo unit, the experience was unlike any
          familiar laptop usage. The device resembled a single piece of glass,
          with floating Windows icons and cursor movements resembling mid-air
          interaction, akin to using an AR headset. While intriguing, grasping
          the concept of a transparent screen laptop required more time to
          acclimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standout feature of the device is its 17.3-inch MicroLED
          transparent display, boasting 55% transparency. Although visible from
          behind, the display becomes less transparent as pixels illuminate,
          lending a magical, dystopian aesthetic to the user experience. Despite
          its allure, the laptop&apos;s bulkiness contrasts sharply with the
          sleekness of a MacBook Air, featuring a dual-screen design with a
          capacitive touchscreen and trackpad on the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon further exploration, I discovered that the keyboard functions as
          a projection that vanishes when a stylus approaches or when the user
          steps away, transforming the secondary touchscreen into a drawing
          surface. Additionally, a camera positioned below the display hinge
          facilitates object identification and generative AI, displaying
          relevant information about objects placed behind the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Lenovo ThinkBook Transparent laptop demo impressed, it
          remains far from retail availability. Questions regarding its
          practicality and user experience must be addressed, especially
          considering the limited resolution of the MicroLED panel, currently
          restricted to HD quality. Lenovo acknowledges the challenge of
          achieving Full HD resolution on a transparent display, underscoring
          the need for further development before market release.

          Apple&apos;s recently launched Vision Pro headset is undergoing
          rigorous testing, revealing a surprising level of durability. Sam Kohl
          from AppleTrack, a tech YouTube channel, subjected the futuristic
          wearable to various forms of abuse, including intentional drops,
          collisions with walls, and bumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vision Pro&apos;s glass demonstrated remarkable resilience to
          everyday wear and tear, surviving intentional impacts against walls
          with only minor scuffs and no shattering. The front panel proved
          exceptionally sturdy, withstanding multiple drops from considerable
          heights. Even with the headset&apos;s weight of 600 to 650 grams, it
          took eight high falls to eventually cause the front glass to splinter.
          Notably, the twin internal and external screens continued to function
          properly despite the damaged cover.

          However, the peripheral speakers faced challenges during the
          durability tests. One speaker ceased to function after several impacts
          against the wall, and the connections to the headband eventually
          broke, leading to a loss of power. The lightweight magnetic light
          seals also tended to detach easily upon impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these issues, the overall durability of the Vision Pro
          impressed, showcasing resilience to reasonable mishaps. It should be
          noted that while the front glass demonstrated strength, repairing a
          damaged screen comes with a significant cost. Without AppleCare, the
          repair is priced at $799, and with the protection plan, it is $299.
          For other damages, Apple quotes up to $2,399, emphasizing the
          importance of handling the headset with care to avoid potential repair
          expenses.

          A groundbreaking study proposes an innovative strategy to address the
          memory issues associated with Alzheimer&apos;s and related dementia,
          diverging from the conventional focus on reducing toxic proteins.
          Published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation by researchers at
          the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the study explores the
          potential of targeting the protein KIBRA, primarily found in the
          kidneys and brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to prevailing research, which aims to diminish toxic proteins
          in the brain, the team, led by senior author Tara Tracy, Assistant
          Professor at Buck, concentrates on reversing the damage caused by
          Alzheimer&apos;s. KIBRA, predominantly located at synapses in the
          human brain, plays a crucial role in memory formation and recall. The
          study reveals that Alzheimer&apos;s brains exhibit a deficiency in
          KIBRA, prompting the researchers to investigate its impact on synaptic
          signaling.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full h-72 sm:h-96 bg-slate-200 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Measuring KIBRA levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the team observed
          an inverse relationship between levels in the fluid and the brain,
          correlating with dementia severity. Surprisingly, a strong correlation
          emerged between increased tau levels—a toxic protein associated with
          Alzheimer&apos;s—and elevated KIBRA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand KIBRA&apos;s influence on synapses, the researchers
          created a functional version of the protein and tested it on lab mice
          with Alzheimer&apos;s-like conditions. The results indicated that
          KIBRA has the potential to reverse the specific memory impairment
          linked to this form of dementia, suggesting its ability to rescue
          mechanisms supporting synaptic resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The findings open the door to the possibility of using KIBRA as a
          treatment to enhance memory, even in the presence of toxic proteins
          responsible for damage in Alzheimer&apos;s. The study marks a
          significant shift in the approach to Alzheimer&apos;s treatment,
          focusing on repairing synaptic function rather than solely reducing
          toxic protein accumulation. The researchers are now working on
          developing a therapy based on these promising results.

          Tech CEOs are scheduled to testify on Wednesday at a Senate Judiciary
          Committee hearing addressing child safety concerns on social media
          platforms. During the hearing, executives from X, TikTok, Discord,
          Meta, and Snap are expected to provide rare commitments to policies
          and endorse regulations, according to representatives from these
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          These hearings involving tech CEOs are typically contentious, and this
          one is anticipated to be no different. However, company
          representatives have stated that their CEOs will extend olive branches
          by expressing support for legislative initiatives and providing
          assurances on policy matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wifredo Fernandez, Chief of U.S. and Canadian Public Policy at X,
          informed NBC News that CEO Linda Yaccarino plans to endorse the SHIELD
          Act and other legislation related to child safety. The SHIELD Act,
          proposed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., seeks to criminalize the
          transmission of nonconsensual intimate images and sexualized
          depictions of children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several other child safety bills have been introduced in the Senate,
          including the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which aims to establish a
          &quot;duty of care&quot; for social media companies recommending
          content to minors. Additionally, the Stop CSAM Act focuses on
          expanding protections for minor victims and enhancing reporting
          requirements for child abuse, making it easier for victims to request
          content removal from platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Snap has already expressed support for KOSA, aligning it with their
          existing policies. In November, Meta advocated for federal legislation
          requiring parental approval for teens under 16 downloading apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          While tech companies have been slow to support industry regulations,
          the Senate Judiciary Committee sees these hearings as a strategy to
          publicly pressure CEOs into making commitments and pave the way for
          legislation this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linda Yaccarino is not the only CEO making announcements during the
          hearing. Snap&apos;s CEO Evan Spiegel is expected to share that the
          company will not further deploy encryption on Snapchat in ways that
          could impede scanning for child sexual abuse material. Although parts
          of Snapchat are already encrypted, the platform proactively scans
          messages and communications for such content or indications of
          dangerous behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption deployment in apps has sparked controversy, with child
          safety advocates arguing that end-to-end encryption hinders law
          enforcement investigations into potential child predators. On the
          other hand, privacy advocates consider encryption a human right,
          providing protection from surveillance for victims and whistleblowers.

          As humans, our emotional connections aren&apos;t always chosen, and
          the news of NASA&apos;s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter concluding its
          mission feels akin to learning about the passing of a beloved figure.
          While Ingenuity may not have celebrity status, its significant
          contributions to humanity&apos;s space exploration endeavors are
          undeniable. Transported to Mars within the Perseverance Rover, it
          landed on February 18, 2021, and on April 19 of the same year, it
          achieved a historic feat as the first powered controlled flight on a
          celestial body other than Earth.

        </div>
        <p>
          Originally designed for a technology demonstration with plans for up
          to five experimental flights over 30 days, Ingenuity surpassed
          expectations. Nearly three years later, it executed a remarkable 72
          flights, covering over 14 times the intended distance and logging two
          hours of flight time. Acting as an aerial scout for the Perseverance
          rover, its remarkable achievements led one to consider
          &quot;Scout&quot; as a fitting alternative name for the helicopter.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, all journeys, whether positive or challenging, must
          eventually conclude. The Ingenuity team planned a brief vertical hop
          on January 18 to assess its location after an emergency landing in a
          previous flight. Telemetry data revealed a successful ascent to 12
          meters, hovering for 4.5 seconds before descending at one meter per
          second. Unfortunately, contact with Perseverance was lost when it was
          about a meter above the surface. While communication was restored the
          following day, images showed damage to one rotor blade during landing,
          rendering Ingenuity incapable of further flight. NASA is investigating
          the communication dropout and the helicopter&apos;s orientation at
          touchdown, but one certainty remains – Ingenuity&apos;s mission on
          Mars has come to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not far from what may be Ingenuity&apos;s final resting place, the
          Perseverance rover persists in its mission. Tasked with exploring
          signs of past and present life on Mars, recent research led by UCLA
          and the University of Oslo, published in Science Advances, confirmed
          the existence of an ancient lake in the Jezero crater, shared by both
          the rover and the helicopter. The study reveals that the crater was
          once filled with water, depositing sediment layers on the floor. The
          subsequent shrinking of the lake and the erosion of sediments formed a
          massive delta. Perseverance&apos;s ground-penetrating radar provided
          data for this discovery, illustrating epochs of environmental changes.
          The rover is actively collecting rock and soil samples, with the hope
          that these specimens may contain traces of life, further fueled by the
          confirmation of lake sediments on the Red Planet.

        <p>
          Fossil Group, an American watchmaker, has decided to cease production
          of smartwatches, marking the end of its efforts to introduce stylish
          tech timepieces to the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company announced on Friday that its latest Gen 6 watch, utilizing
          Google&apos;s Wear OS software, will be its final foray into the
          smartwatch category. Fossil&apos;s departure comes as the landscape
          has shifted, with tech giants such as Google and Samsung dominating
          with their own branded devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spokesperson for the Texas-based firm stated, &quot;We have made the
          strategic decision to exit the smartwatch business and redirect
          resources to our core strengths.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sub-brands under Fossil, including Michael Kors, Skagen, and Diesel,
          will also discontinue their smartwatch lines. The company has
          committed to providing support for existing models for a limited
          period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fossil had been among the few traditional watchmakers attempting to
          adapt to the emerging smartwatch trend over the past decade, despite
          the neglect of the struggling Wear OS platform by major players.
          However, the category gained traction in 2021 when Google and Samsung
          collaborated on a significant software update.
        </p>
        <p>
          Industry analysts suggest that Fossil struggled to compete with the
          marketing power and resources of tech giants. The lack of a new
          smartwatch model since 2021 signaled the company&apos;s gradual
          withdrawal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fossil was known for its focus on fashionable design in the smartwatch
          space. With its departure, there is an opportunity for other players
          to step in and offer sleek, designer tech watches.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, Fossil intends to focus on its traditional watches,
          jewelry, and leather goods. Despite the mainstream popularity of
          smartwatches, traditional timepieces still constitute the majority of
          Fossil&apos;s business.

          Six children who were born deaf have regained their hearing after
          undergoing an experimental treatment involving an injection directly
          into the ear. The treatment, developed by researchers from Fudan
          University in China and co-led by scientists from Harvard Medical
          School at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, targeted a specific genetic
          mutation responsible for inherited deafness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The children, aged one to seven, all had a mutation in the OTOF gene,
          which affects the production of a protein crucial for transmitting
          signals from the ear to the brain. Over the 26-week trial period, five
          of the six children showed significant improvement in hearing, with
          four experiencing robust outcomes. The results, published in the
          journal Lancet, also revealed enhancements in speech perception among
          the responsive participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          This breakthrough offers hope for treating various genetic forms of
          deafness and underscores the potential of gene therapy in addressing
          congenital hearing impairments. The targeted gene, OTOF, encodes the
          otoferlin protein, vital for relaying auditory signals from cochlear
          cells to nerves in the inner ear. By delivering a modified version of
          the gene using a viral vector, researchers successfully restored
          otoferlin production in the cochlea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite facing initial challenges due to the gene&apos;s size, the
          team devised a solution by splitting the gene into two parts and
          delivering them separately. The injected viral mixture reached the
          target cells in the inner ear fluid, prompting the assembly of the
          complete protein. Within four to six weeks of treatment, participants
          began showing signs of hearing improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The success of this approach, particularly in patients with cochlear
          implants, highlights its potential to complement existing hearing
          restoration methods. Notably, the therapy enabled older children with
          implants to understand and respond to speech without assistance, even
          in noisy environments. While the youngest participants exhibited
          positive trends, further evaluation is needed to gauge their long-term
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, one participant did not respond to the treatment, possibly
          due to an immune response to the viral vector. Despite this setback,
          the promising results underscore the significance of targeted gene
          therapy in addressing genetic deafness, offering renewed hope for
          individuals with congenital hearing loss worldwide.

          Described as &quot;inspired by the vibrant hue found in nature&quot;
          and touted as a &quot;luminous color that invites the mind into a
          state of energizing calmness,&quot; mint is Google&apos;s bold attempt
          to infuse a sense of daring, focus, and optimism into the new year.
          The promotional materials suggest it&apos;s a color for those aiming
          for a &quot;fresher version of you.&quot; The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro,
          equipped with Google&apos;s latest Tensor G3 chipset, promise
          efficient and fast performance. Paired with UFS 4.0 storage, users can
          access their files swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of photography, the Pixel 8 features a 50-megapixel main
          camera with advanced Octa-PD technology for excellent low-light
          performance. It also boasts an 8x Super-Res digital zoom for capturing
          distant subjects, along with a 12-megapixel sensor for detailed
          close-up shots. For selfies and video calls, the front camera is a
          10.5-megapixel shooter. The Pixel 8 houses a 4,575mAh battery,
          ensuring a full day&apos;s usage, and supports 27W fast wired charging
          and 18W wireless charging.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the Pixel 8 Pro offers a 6.7-inch QHD+ OLED display
          with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for added durability. It features a
          10.5-megapixel selfie camera and a powerful trio of rear cameras,
          including a 50-megapixel main camera, a new 48-megapixel ultrawide
          sensor, and a 48-megapixel 5x zoom camera. The design of the Pixel 8
          Pro combines glass and metal, reminiscent of the previous Pixel 7 Pro.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the hood, the Pixel 8 Pro runs on the Google Tensor G3 chip and
          packs a 5,050mAh battery. It supports 30W wired charging and 23W

          enhanced security, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The phone also
          includes a temperature monitoring sensor and an ultrasonic in-display
          fingerprint scanner.
        </p>
        <p>
          A unique addition to the Pixel 8 Pro is the Melexis MLX90632 skin
          temperature sensor, positioned near the cameras. Dedicated solely to
          accurate temperature readings and not enhancing photography, this
          feature could have various practical applications beyond traditional
          smartphone functions.

        <p>
          Swiggy is reportedly on the verge of downsizing its workforce, aiming
          to cut around 400 employees, which accounts for approximately 6
          percent of its total staff. This move comes as part of a strategic
          shift by the company and reflects a broader trend of major layoffs
          impacting technology firms globally. Here is a comprehensive overview
          of the situation:
        </p>
        <p>
          Swiggy&apos;s decision to lay off nearly 400 employees marks the
          second instance in the last 12 months, according to a report by Money
          Control. The impact is expected to be felt across various teams,
          including technology, call centers, and corporate roles. This
          strategic move is reportedly geared towards optimizing the
          company&apos;s operations and aligning its workforce with evolving
          business priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reports suggest that the layoffs will be implemented gradually over
          the next few weeks. This phased approach is aimed at facilitating a
          smoother transition while minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.
          However, details regarding whether severance pay would be provided to
          the impacted employees remain undisclosed at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year in January, Swiggy had undergone a similar process, laying
          off around 380 employees. At that time, the reasons cited included a
          slowdown in growth and overhiring. Interestingly, the current
          downsizing comes at a juncture when Swiggy is aggressively expanding
          its grocery delivery service, Swiggy Instamart. This shift suggests
          that the company is strategically realigning its workforce to enhance
          efficiency and better position itself in the competitive market.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Swiggy has not officially confirmed the latest round of layoffs,
          reports strongly indicate that the company is actively working on
          optimizing costs. This move is seen as a strategic step to showcase
          improved financials as Swiggy gears up for its Initial Public Offering
          (IPO). Swiggy&apos;s focus on cost optimization is in line with the
          broader trend of tech companies striving for financial robustness
          before entering public markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech industry is witnessing a season of layoffs, and Swiggy&apos;s
          move aligns with this trend. For instance, Microsoft has also
          announced a fresh round of layoffs affecting its gaming divisions,
          including Xbox and Blizzard. This indicates a collective industry-wide
          effort to adapt to changing dynamics and optimize operations for
          sustained growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, Swiggy&apos;s decision to trim its workforce reflects a
          dynamic business environment where companies are making strategic
          adjustments to stay competitive. As the tech industry undergoes
          transformations, optimizing operations and ensuring financial
          stability become crucial factors, and Swiggy&apos;s move appears to be
          in sync with these industry-wide imperatives.

        <p>
          When the Samsung Galaxy S24 series was unveiled recently, it
          introduced advanced AI features, many of which were developed in
          collaboration with Google. While several of these features were
          exclusively launched with the Galaxy S24 series, some, such as live
          transcribe in the Recording app and object remover in the Photos app,
          were already available on Pixel phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, Google collaborated with Samsung to bring certain features
          to the Galaxy S24 phones that were initially exclusive to Google.
          However, some features are entirely exclusive to Samsung phones, with
          not even the Pixel 8 series having access to them. Notably, features
          like Circle to Search, point and search with Google Lens, Live
          Translate, Magic Compose, and Android Auto integration are the
          outcomes of the partnership between Samsung and Google. The Samsung
          Galaxy S24 series heavily relies on Gemini AI, Google&apos;s new
          multimodal model system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galaxy S24 series incorporates Google&apos;s latest Gemini AI
          model, encompassing all three versions — Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra, and
          Gemini Nano — across various default applications on the smartphones.
          Specifically, the utilization of Gemini Pro on the Galaxy S24 series
          enhances interactions with Samsung apps, providing users with
          summarization and translation features in apps like Samsung Notes,
          Voice Recorder, and Keyboard. Additionally, Imagen 2 on the Galaxy S24
          series allows users to access Generative Edit features within the
          Samsung Gallery app.
        </p>
        <p>
          While these features are undoubtedly beneficial for the Galaxy S24
          series, it raises a question: Is Google, by collaborating with Samsung
          to embed AI features in its phones, potentially undermining its own
          Pixel phones?
        </p>
        <p>
          To some extent, yes. However, it&apos;s crucial to recognize that for
          Google, Pixels represent just a small component of its broader
          strategy. Google is a multinational corporation first and foremost,
          prioritizing profitability and the growth of its Android ecosystem.
          The collaboration with Samsung aligns with Google&apos;s overarching
          goal of expanding its Android ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deal with Samsung ensured that Gemini AI and Imagen 2 features,
          while exclusive to the Galaxy S24 series, were accessible to a broader
          audience. While keeping these features exclusive to Google Pixel could
          have provided some bragging rights, they wouldn&apos;t have reached as
          many users. Samsung also plans to roll out these features to the
          previous year&apos;s S23 series soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          For context, Samsung received over 250,000 pre-booking orders for the
          Galaxy S24 Ultra in India alone, and in 2023, the Galaxy S23 Ultra
          sold 11.63 million units. In comparison, Google sold a total of 10
          million units of both Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro phones in India
          throughout the entire previous year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prabhu Ram, who leads the Industry Intelligence Group at CyberMedia
          Research (CMR), provides insight into such deals between Samsung and
          Google. He explains, “By strategically sharing its AI features with
          other Android OEMs, such as Samsung, Google is casting a wider net ––
          unlocking new lucrative revenue streams through potential partnerships
          while also fueling the continuous refinement of its AI tech,
          ultimately benefiting not just Pixel users but the entire Android
          ecosystem.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Deals like these are not uncommon, as evidenced by recent revelations
          during Epic Games&apos; testimony that Google committed to paying
          Samsung $8 billion over four years. This financial arrangement aimed
          to establish Google Search, Google Assistant, and Play Store as
          default options on Samsung&apos;s mobile devices, similar to how
          Google pays Apple for the default search engine on iPhones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, the exposure of products like Gemini AI and Imagen 2
          expands significantly when they debut in devices like Samsung Galaxy
          flagship phones. While Google may have foregone exclusive features on
          the Pixel 8 series, the collaboration likely brought in substantial
          revenue, and a broader user base will contribute to enhancing its AI
          tools.

          Silicon Valley appears to be anticipating another wave of layoffs,
          with major tech companies announcing large-scale job cuts. Following
          Google, Meta, Amazon, and other Silicon Valley giants, Microsoft has
          now disclosed a new round of layoffs within its gaming division,
          encompassing Activision Blizzard and Xbox. Approximately 1,900 roles
          out of 22,000 will be affected, constituting around 8 percent of the
          overall Microsoft Gaming division. The job cuts coincide with the
          departure of a significant executive from Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft is Implementing Layoffs in its Gaming Division: Microsoft
          has recently declared a new round of job cuts within its gaming
          division, which encompasses Activision Blizzard and Xbox. The company
          is downsizing its gaming workforce by around 1,900 positions out of
          the 22,000 people in its team. This decision is part of an effort to
          streamline operations and concentrate on new projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer conveyed this information in an
          internal memo to employees, stating, &quot;As part of this process, we
          have made the painful decision to reduce the size of our gaming
          workforce by approximately 1,900 roles out of the 22,000 people on our
          team. The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating
          this process as thoughtfully as possible.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Departures of Blizzard President and Chief Design Officer: The
          restructuring changes at Microsoft are impacting key figures within
          Blizzard, the game developer behind popular titles like World of
          Warcraft and Overwatch. Alongside the layoffs, Blizzard President Mike
          Ybarra and Chief Design Officer Allen Adham have opted to leave the
          company after playing crucial roles in leadership and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft&apos;s game content and studios president, Matt Booty,
          confirmed these developments in an internal memo and announced that a
          new president for Blizzard would be appointed the following week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellation of Blizzard&apos;s Survival Game Project: As part of the
          organizational changes leading to layoffs and the resignation of key
          executives, Microsoft has decided to abandon a survival game project
          being developed by Blizzard. Booty mentioned that those involved in
          this project would be reassigned to other exciting opportunities in
          the early stages of development at Blizzard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft Extends Support to Impacted Employees: Microsoft has
          emphasized its commitment to navigating the layoff process
          thoughtfully and providing support to affected employees. Impacted
          individuals are being informed through meetings starting today. Those
          equipped to work from home and prefer to do so can work remotely.
          Microsoft expressed confidence in its team&apos;s ability to create
          and nurture games, stories, and worlds that bring players together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft Follows the Broader Trend of Tech Layoffs: Microsoft is not
          alone in downsizing its workforce, as other major tech companies have
          also resorted to layoffs recently, according to layoffs.fyi, a site
          tracking tech layoffs. Google, YouTube, Amazon, Meta, and TikTok have
          all announced job cuts in various departments, including hardware,
          engineering, media, film, and technical program management, affecting
          hundreds of employees. Reasons cited for these layoffs include the
          need to reorganize, focus on key projects, cope with the slowdown in
          ad revenue, and pursue new visions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The layoffs at Microsoft and other tech companies underscore the
          challenges and opportunities in the tech industry, impacted by the
          pandemic, the shift to cloud computing, the rise of automation, and
          the need for innovation. Microsoft aims to adapt to these changes and
          grow its business by bringing more games to players worldwide. The
          company last announced significant layoffs a year ago, affecting
          10,000 employees.

        <p>
          If you own an iPhone in Europe, significant changes are on the
          horizon. Apple has recently unveiled updates for European iPhone
          users, allowing them to download apps from sources beyond the
          traditional App Store. While this expansion provides users with more
          choices, Apple is also introducing additional safety measures to
          safeguard against potential risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The driving force behind these updates is the Digital Markets Act
          (DMA), a set of regulations mandating that Apple broaden options for
          European users and implement safeguards to protect them from potential
          hazards associated with new apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users, these changes mean increased flexibility in installing apps
          from various sources, granting access to a wider array of applications
          on their iPhones. Essentially, this opens up more avenues for
          discovering both entertaining and practical applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers are also impacted positively by these updates. Apple is
          providing them with new tools to share their apps through alternative
          app stores and payment methods, offering greater flexibility. Safety
          for developers is enhanced through measures like Notarization, a
          process that verifies the safety of an app before it can be
          downloaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with these changes, potential risks emerge, such as the
          possibility of harmful or deceptive apps. In response, Apple is
          implementing safety measures, including a thorough app check
          (Notarization) to ensure apps are secure for iPhone users. Additional
          information about apps will be provided to users before downloading to
          enhance transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users who browse the internet using Safari on their iPhones will
          encounter a new screen prompting them to select their default browser.
          This adjustment is a result of the new rules Apple is obliged to
          follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          For developers selling apps in Europe, new payment handling options
          are introduced. Apple is giving them the choice to utilize different
          payment services and direct users to their websites for purchases. To
          keep users informed, Apple will include labels and information sheets
          whenever there are variations, allowing users to make informed
          decisions based on their comfort level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Apple is altering the revenue landscape for developers.
          Reduced fees for using the App Store are being offered, but developers
          must adhere to new business terms to avail themselves of these
          benefits. This signifies a shift in how developers can monetize their
          apps on Apple&apos;s platform.

          Samsung is actively pursuing the development of cutting-edge health
          sensors to rival Apple, as reported by Bloomberg&apos;s Mark Gurman.
          The company&apos;s goal is to incorporate noninvasive blood glucose
          monitoring and continuous blood pressure tracking across its product
          range.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative is part of Samsung&apos;s broader strategy to
          integrate advanced health features, exemplified by the recently
          unveiled Galaxy Ring smart ring. Hon Pak, a Samsung executive leading
          the health technology initiative, envisions providing consumers with a
          comprehensive overview of their well-being through sensors deployed on
          various body parts and within the home environment.
        </p>

          pivotal advancement. He stated, &quot;If we can do continuous blood
          pressure and glucose, we&apos;re in a whole different ballgame. I
          think that&apos;s where everyone is trying to get to. We&apos;re
          putting significant investment toward that.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s crucial to note that Apple has been actively working for
          years on developing a noninvasive glucose reader, a technology that
          holds immense potential benefits for diabetics. However, Pak refrains
          from providing a specific timeline for Samsung&apos;s
          technology&apos;s market debut, expressing optimism that some form of
          noninvasive glucose monitoring could become a reality within the next
          five years.

          The Galaxy Ring, recently introduced by Samsung and set for release by
          the end of 2024, will initially focus on tracking activity and sleep.
          Additional health features are planned for future updates. The
          discreet form factor of the ring may appeal to individuals seeking
          health tracking in a less conspicuous device compared to smartwatches.
          While pricing details are yet to be finalized, the Galaxy Ring is
          expected to lack iPhone compatibility, unlike Samsung&apos;s watches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gurman highlights the challenges associated with creating a
          noninvasive blood sugar monitor, noting Apple&apos;s struggles despite
          a decade of effort. Samsung is also working on enhancing blood
          pressure tracking on its smartwatches, aiming for reduced calibration
          requirements. Pak underscores the goal of providing blood pressure
          assessments that focus more on indicating cardiovascular risk rather
          than providing precise values.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to smart rings and watches, Samsung is exploring the
          integration of new sensors into earbuds. These sensors could track
          temperature and heart rate, leveraging the ear canal&apos;s proximity
          to the heart for more accurate measurements. The data from earbuds,
          combined with wrist-based measurements and environmental factors, aims
          to offer a more holistic health overview.

          Apple is releasing the iOS 17.3 update, introducing notable features
          such as &apos;Stolen Device Protection&apos; and &apos;Collaborative
          Apple Music Playlists.&apos; This update aims to enhance security
          measures and offer new avenues for interactive music experiences.
          Let&apos;s delve into the key highlights of iOS 17.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">Stolen Device Protection:</span>{" "}
          Addressing iPhone theft concerns, Apple introduces the &apos;Stolen
          Device Protection&apos; feature. This security enhancement imposes
          additional safeguards when the device is in locations outside of
          trusted environments like home or work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the device passcode, the feature incorporates biometric
          authentication requirements for tasks such as accessing iCloud-stored
          passwords, making Safari purchases, disabling Lost Mode, changing
          Apple ID credentials, altering the iPhone passcode, and initiating
          device data erasure. To activate this feature, users can navigate to
          the &apos;Face ID & Passcode&apos; section within device settings and
          enable the &apos;Stolen Device Protection&apos; toggle. This valuable
          security layer is applicable to all iPhones running iOS 17.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">
            Collaborative Apple Music Playlists:
          </span>{" "}
          iOS 17.3 introduces the much-awaited feature of collaborative
          playlists on Apple Music. This functionality, previously available in
          beta versions, empowers users to create playlists or leverage existing
          ones and invite friends or family to contribute songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To engage in this collaborative music experience, users can launch
          Apple Music, access a playlist, and tap on the person icon. This
          action generates a shareable link, enabling others to join and add
          songs to the playlist. Additionally, users listening to collaborative
          playlists can express reactions with emojis, such as hearts or thumbs
          up, which animate when the corresponding song is played.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">AirPlay Support for Hotels:</span> In
          a move to enhance user experiences in select hotels, iOS 17.3
          introduces AirPlay support. Users with updated devices can now
          seamlessly stream content from Apple devices like iPads, iPhones, and
          Macs in hotels deemed compatible with AirPlay by Apple. This
          functionality enables users to enjoy content from various streaming
          platforms on larger screens within the hotel environment, using their
          individual credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">AppleCare Coverage Display:</span>{" "}
          Another notable addition in iOS 17.3 is the display of AppleCare
          coverage for all devices associated with a user&apos;s Apple account.
          This information is conveniently accessible under the &apos;AppleCare
          and Warranty&apos; section within the &apos;General&apos; tab in the
          Settings app. This feature provides users with a comprehensive
          overview of AppleCare coverage for all their signed-in devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the iOS 17.3 update signifies Apple&apos;s commitment
          to enhancing user security, collaboration in music experiences, and
          seamless content streaming in select hotel environments. With these
          new features, Apple continues to refine and enrich the user experience
          across its range of devices.

          For those seeking a compact phone with flagship features at a more
          affordable price, the choice between the Apple iPhone 15 and the
          Samsung Galaxy S24 can be challenging. In this comparison, we&apos;ll
          explore key aspects to assist you in making an informed decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the base models of the Galaxy S24 series and the iPhone 15 series
          feature flat displays with aluminum frames, maintaining consistency
          with their predecessors. However, design distinctions emerge, with the
          Galaxy S24 sporting a punch-hole display and the iPhone 15 adopting
          the Dynamic Island from the iPhone 14 Pro series. Back designs also
          differ, with Samsung opting for individual cutouts for each camera
          lens, while Apple employs a sizable camera island in the top left
          corner. Despite these differences, both phones exhibit similarities to
          their predecessors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galaxy S24, slightly lighter than the iPhone 15 by 4 grams, boasts
          a marginally larger 6.2-inch screen compared to the iPhone&apos;s 6.1
          inches. Both displays exhibit brightness under direct sunlight, but
          the Galaxy S24 gains an edge in scrolling responsiveness with its high
          refresh rate 120Hz display, surpassing the iPhone 15&apos;s 60Hz
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing between the two depends on user experience preferences. If
          you are already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, the iPhone 15 may
          better suit your needs. Software-wise, the devices run on different
          operating systems, reflecting a matter of personal preference.
          Notably, the Galaxy S24&apos;s AI-powered features and a seven-year
          update policy, compared to the iPhone&apos;s five-year policy, offer
          potential advantages for Samsung users. Additionally, the Galaxy S24
          features an always-on display, leveraging its LTPO screen to conserve
          battery when enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of functionality, while the iPhone 15 maintains familiarity
          with previous models, the Galaxy S24 introduces AI-powered
          capabilities such as live call translation, &apos;Chat Assist,&apos;
          and &apos;Circle to Search&apos; through Galaxy AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance-wise, the Galaxy S24, equipped with the Exynos 2400
          chipset (benchmarks pending), competes with the iPhone 15 featuring
          Apple&apos;s A16 Bionic chipset. Although real-world performance
          remains to be seen, both phones are expected to handle multitasking
          without noticeable lag.
        </p>
        <p>
          The camera setups vary, with the Galaxy S24 featuring a 50MP primary
          camera, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom.
          The iPhone 15 opts for a 48MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide, but lacks
          a dedicated telephoto lens. The choice may hinge on personal
          preference for portrait shots or consideration for video recording
          capabilities, with the Galaxy S24 supporting 8K recording compared to
          the iPhone 15&apos;s 4K limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite a larger on-paper battery capacity in the Galaxy S24,
          Apple&apos;s software optimization may result in similar screen-on
          times. Both phones offer comparable charging speeds, claiming a 50%
          charge in 30 minutes. Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging
          at 15W and 4.5W, respectively, provide additional flexibility for both
          devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pricing-wise, the Galaxy S24 and iPhone 15 fall within the same
          bracket, with the former priced at Rs 79,999 and the latter starting
          from Rs 79,990. Choosing between them depends on individual needs and
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the enduring Android vs. iOS debate, the Galaxy S24 stands out for
          those desiring generative AI features and frequent software updates.
          On the other hand, the iPhone 15 presents an excellent choice for
          Apple enthusiasts seeking value for money. Ultimately, the decision
          hinges on whether advanced AI capabilities or brand loyalty guides
          your smartphone preferences.

          Riot Games, renowned for creating League of Legends and Valorant,
          declared on Monday its decision to terminate approximately 530 jobs,
          constituting 11% of its workforce. This strategic move aligns with a
          broader trend in the gaming industry and tech sector, where major
          companies are downsizing specific divisions to address escalating
          costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a blog post, Riot Games CEO Dylan Jadeja explained the rationale
          behind the layoffs. He emphasized that the company&apos;s rapid
          expansion in recent years, more than doubling its headcount, led to
          efforts being spread thin across numerous projects. The lack of clear
          prioritization prompted the need for adjustments to refocus on
          initiatives with the greatest impact on player experience while
          cutting investments in less crucial areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The impact of the layoffs will be most significant in teams outside of
          core development. Riot Games remains committed to prioritizing its
          core live games, including League of Legends, Valorant, Teamfight
          Tactics, and Wild Rift, along with associated esports and events.
          However, the company will halt new game development under Riot Forge
          and trim features in Legends of Runeterra, citing its underperformance
          relative to expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          While expressing pride in past achievements, particularly in bringing
          stories to life, Jadeja emphasized the necessity to redirect efforts
          toward Riot&apos;s ongoing ambitious projects. Riot Games, a
          subsidiary of the Chinese tech giant Tencent, has gained recognition
          for its esports-centric popular franchises. In addition to game
          development, Riot expanded its reach into entertainment with the
          production of the Arcane TV show on Netflix. The company,
          headquartered in Los Angeles, boasts a workforce of over 4,500
          employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision to reduce staff at Riot Games coincides with recent
          layoffs at tech giants like Google and Amazon. The trend of downsizing
          has affected prominent developers such as ByteDance, Niantic, Epic
          Games, and Ubisoft. Analysts foresee further job cuts in the tech
          sector, with an estimated 7,500 positions eliminated since the
          beginning of the year. The evolving landscape indicates a broader
          industry response to economic challenges and shifting priorities
          within the gaming and tech sectors.

          Beyond the single-player mode, Palworld has a multiplayer mode
          requiring teamwork to take on tough Pals and craft items to survive
          the harsh world. Gameplay involves base building like Minecraft, with
          the ability to loot other players&apos; bases and items.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can utilize enslaved Pals to construct bases, assign them tasks,
          force them to work, engage in farming, build houses and more. Each Pal
          has a distinct personality and food needs, suitable for different
          roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within just 8 hours of its early access launch on the popular Steam
          marketplace, Palworld sold over 1 million copies. Recently, some
          connectivity issues arose but developers quickly resolved them.
          Palworld has now surpassed Counter-Strike 2 as the game with the most
          concurrent players on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the controversial new game Palworld, which allows
          capturing and exploiting Pokemon-like creatures, has seen immense
          immediate success, selling 3 million copies and becoming a top-played
          title globally shortly after launching. Its unique mix of
          Pokemon-style collection and open-world survival gameplay has
          resonated widely despite ethical concerns.

        <p>
          The Astrobiotic mission was intended to be the first American soft
          landing on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. After detecting the fuel
          leak, Astrobiotic pivoted the mission to operate more like a
          satellite. They tested Peregrine&apos;s scientific instruments and
          systems as it flew thousands of kilometers before directing it to burn
          up in Earth&apos;s atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          If successful, it would have been the first private soft lunar
          landing, following the Israeli Beresheet mission in 2019 and Japanese
          UTO mission in 2023 which did achieve crash landings on the surface.
          Unfortunately, Peregrine did not progress as far.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the same day as Peregrine&apos;s loss of signal, the Japan
          Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) confirmed its Smart Lander for
          Investigating Moon (SLIM) successfully touched down, making Japan the
          fifth nation to accomplice a soft lunar landing after the U.S., Soviet
          Union, China and India.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the mission dubbed the “moon sniper” for its precision 100 meter
          landing capability has run into problems. The spacecraft&apos;s solar
          cells are not generating any power.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAXA attempted some life-sustaining measures like switching off
          SLIM&apos;s heater, but the battery can only endure for a few hours on
          the moon&apos;s surface. JAXA hopes a change in sunlight angle will
          energize the solar panels again.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been several moon missions in the last two years - Japan’s
          SLIM and Hakuto, Russia’s Luna-25, India&apos;s Chandrayaan-3,
          Peregrine and more, with varying outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This emphasizes the new space race and push to establish a sustained
          lunar presence. Once we have a moon base, it can propel missions
          deeper into space. While that future is distant, space technology has
          already benefited daily life with smartphone cameras, memory foam
          mattresses and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, advancements may enable connecting directly to satellite networks
          using just smartphones, without specialized hardware like satellite
          terminals or phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google, AT&T and Vodafone have invested over $155 million in AST
          SpaceMobile to develop direct-to-device satellite connectivity. In
          2023, the company demonstrated 2G, 4G and 5G calls and 14 Mbps
          downloads directly from a satellite to regular smartphones using those
          companies&apos; networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google will collaborate on product development, testing and
          implementation to enable SpaceMobile connectivity for Android devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while the two recent moon missions had different fates, the
          constant push to explore space will continue advancing technology that
          improves life on Earth too. Focus on the cosmos beyond will lead to
          innovations that enrich our world.

          WhatsApp has rolled out several new capabilities for its Channels
          feature to improve engagement between brands, celebrities, public
          figures and their audiences on the platform. Introduced in late 2022,
          Channels enables direct communication from these users to their
          followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted four key additions to WhatsApp
          Channels - voice messages, polls, multiple admins and content sharing
          to Status. These updates, now out of testing, will be available to all
          users soon on an unspecified date.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major change allows Channel admins to send voice messages. This
          provides a quick, personal way to share behind-the-scenes insights,
          make announcements and directly interact with followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of polls gives admins a handy tool to gather opinions and
          feedback from their audience on various topics, driving greater
          participation. Support for multiple Channel admins will be invaluable
          for large brands or organizations needing active management and prompt
          responses to incoming messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, followers can now share interesting Channel updates to their
          own WhatsApp Status. This viral feature expands the potential reach of
          content beyond the Channel&apos;s existing followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, these enhancements signal WhatsApp&apos;s efforts to make
          Channels a more engaging, interactive destination for both admins and
          their communities. With voice, polls, co-administration and built-in
          sharing, WhatsApp has meaningfully expanded Channels&apos;
          capabilities since launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          For public figures, brands and businesses, these features optimize
          Channels as a controlled space to foster direct conversations with
          followers at scale. Voice messages bring an authentic, personal touch
          while polls provide data-driven insights into audience preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to have multiple authenticated admins prevents bottlenecks
          in engaging active communities, while viral sharing of content helps
          expand visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          For followers, the updates make Channels a richer source of exclusive
          insights directly from the source. The additions encourage
          participating rather than just observing passive content.
        </p>
        <p>
          As WhatsApp continues developing Channels into a robust platform,
          these user-empowering features will significantly boost the appeal and
          utility for both creators and their communities seeking closer
          connections on WhatsApp.

          Apple has kicked off preorders for its hotly anticipated Vision Pro
          mixed reality headset, with early signs of robust customer demand
          quickly exhausting initial stock of the $3,499 device, as per a
          Bloomberg report.
        </p>
        <p>
          The headset became available for preorder online and on Apple&apos;s
          app at 8am Eastern time on Tuesday. Delivery dates have already been
          pushed back to March 8-15 for orders placed today, indicating either
          limited supplies, strong early interest, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rapid sellouts of in-store pickup appointments on day one at many
          locations also suggest high demand and/or constrained inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expanding options for consumers, Apple unveiled two additional
          configurations beyond the base 256GB model. A 512GB version costs
          $3,699, while a high-end 1TB option is priced at $3,899.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple is also selling a $199 case, $199 extra batteries, and $99
          replacement bands for the headset. However, the unique ordering
          process requires an iPhone or iPad to scan the customer&apos;s face
          for optimal fit and vision prescription if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple has not commented on sales, which is typical for new product
          launches. But Wall Street analysts forecast a measured start for the
          Vision Pro.
        </p>
        <p>
          UBS predicts Apple will ship 300,000-400,000 units this year,
          generating around $1.4 billion revenue. Despite the lofty $3,499 entry
          price, Apple seems to have modest expectations for a gradual launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially only available in the U.S., the headset will expand to other
          markets including the U.K., Canada and China. Per reports, Apple
          internally expects a strong opening weekend followed by declining
          sales in subsequent weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced much higher than Meta&apos;s latest offering, the Vision Pro is
          positioned as a premium device befitting its cutting-edge nature.
          However, the specialized sizing process poses challenges for sharing
          the headset with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unique face scan determines the ideal light seal and strap from 25
          seal options and 2 straps for each individual user. Prescription
          inserts cost extra too. Some testers have also cited the
          headset&apos;s weight as uncomfortable for long-term wear.
        </p>
        <p>
          While niche currently, the mixed reality market offers opportunities
          for Apple to woo its loyal, wealthy customer base with this futuristic
          product. The company&apos;s history of sleek design and intuitive
          interfaces helps cement the Vision Pro as the luxe choice for early
          adopters.

          venture is yet to be finalized.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a separate development, Altman expressed his views on the rapid
          evolution of artificial intelligence during an interview with Axios at
          Davos. He emphasized that AI products must evolve to allow extensive
          individual customization, even if it means causing discomfort to
          certain individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Altman articulated, &quot;If the country said, you know, all gay
          people should be killed on sight, then no ...that is well out of
          bounds. But there are probably other things that I don&apos;t
          personally agree with, but a different culture might. …We have to be
          somewhat uncomfortable as a tool builder with some of the uses of our
          tools,&quot; addressing the ethical considerations surrounding AI
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creator of ChatGPT also offered insights into the future
          capabilities of AI. Altman suggested that, in the near future, users
          might have the ability to query AI about the most significant emails
          received throughout the day, enabling AI to provide concise summaries.
          This potential integration of AI into daily tasks offers a glimpse
          into the evolving landscape of AI applications, showcasing its
          increasing role in enhancing efficiency and convenience for users.

          The highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event is taking place
          today in San Jose, where the tech giant is expected to unveil its most
          advanced lineup of smartphones yet - the Galaxy S24 series. This new
          generation of Galaxy S devices promises major upgrades and
          improvements over their predecessors, making them Samsung&apos;s most
          powerful smartphones to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event is being held at the SAP Center in San Jose, California and
          starts at 1 PM EST for US audiences, while Indian viewers can tune in
          from 11:30 PM IST onwards. Samsung is live streaming the launch on
          their official YouTube channel and social media platforms like
          Facebook, ensuring global accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those interested in following the event through Samsung&apos;s
          official website have the chance to win a INR 5,000 voucher to spend
          on Samsung products. Additionally, by pre-paying INR 1,999, you can
          reserve a spot to be one of the first to purchase the new Galaxy S24
          smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumors suggest that the Galaxy S24+ may be priced between INR 1,04,999
          and INR 1,05,999 for the base 12GB RAM and 256GB storage model. This
          indicates a significant price jump of over INR 10,000 compared to last
          year&apos;s Galaxy S23+ which was priced at INR 94,999.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top-of-the-line Galaxy S24 Ultra is speculated to cost between INR
          1,34,999 and INR 1,35,999 for the same configuration. Again, this is
          approximately INR 10,000 more than the S23 Ultra&apos;s starting price
          of INR 1,24,999. Samsung appears to be considering a price hike for
          its flagship S series, although leaked information implies the company
          may retain existing prices. We will have to wait for official
          confirmation during the launch event.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no available information yet regarding the pricing of the
          standard Galaxy S24. For reference, the S23 was launched at INR 74,999
          last year. Samsung may continue the same starting price for the base
          S24 model, limiting the price increases to the S24+ and S24 Ultra
          only. This mirrors Apple&apos;s strategy with its recent iPhone 15
          lineup.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S24 series have already
          commenced on Samsung&apos;s official website. With powerful upgrades,
          new AI capabilities, and potentially higher prices, Samsung aims to
          position the S24 series as its most premium smartphone range ever.

            <p>
              This Android feature enables searching anything on-screen without

              button then highlight an object with tap, circle, scribble, etc.
              to view contextual information within the app itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if an influencer shows untagged fashion items, circle
              them to instantly find and shop similar styles from various
              retailers. Once done, swipe back to the original app.
            </p>
            <p>
              As per Google, AI upgrades like multisearch (text and image
              queries) already help users grasp concepts and topics by
              aggregating helpful web information. Circle to Search brings that
              convenience directly into any app. It launches first on select
              premium Android devices like the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Galaxy
              S24 series.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;Circle to Search significantly advances expressing needs

              it enables more intuitive, natural search,&quot; said Alistair

          This recharge plan, averaging a monthly cost of Rs 230, will be
          accessible through the My Jio app from January 15 to January 30. Users
          availing of this plan during this period are entitled to a range of

          additional advantages as part of the Republic Day offer, extending

          Microsoft has expanded the availability of Copilot Pro beyond
          enterprises, making it accessible for individuals. This move,
          announced on Tuesday, positions Copilot Pro as a competitor to ChatGPT
          Plus, the premium version of ChatGPT, offering enhanced response times
          and access to cutting-edge models like GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced at Rs 2,000 per month, Copilot Pro is in close competition with
          ChatGPT Plus, available at Rs 1,950 per month. With a minimal price
          difference, these premium AI-driven chatbots target power users
          seeking top-notch AI capabilities. Let&apos;s delve into an analysis
          of these two offerings and how they stack up against each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft collaborates closely with OpenAI, and Copilot is powered by
          the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model, which is the same
          underlying technology that drives ChatGPT. Consequently, the results
          and responses from both chatbots are comparable. Both Copilot Pro and
          ChatGPT Plus provide access to the latest GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo
          models.
        </p>
        <p>
          While both subscriptions offer similar features, ChatGPT Plus has a
          unique advantage—the GPT Store. This store contains over three million
          customized versions of ChatGPT tailored for specific use cases.
          Microsoft has indicated that Copilot Pro users will eventually have
          the capability to create their own GPT, although this feature will be
          added later.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the flip side, Copilot Pro presents an advantage over ChatGPT Plus,
          especially for Microsoft 365 subscribers. Copilot Pro enhances
          applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote with
          generative AI capabilities. This integration enables users to quickly
          create summaries on Word, generate presentations on PowerPoint, and
          draft AI-assisted emails in Outlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both ChatGPT Plus and Copilot Pro allow users to generate images using
          DALL-E, with a limit of up to 100 images per day. Additionally, both
          models provide priority access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo during peak
          times. Once subscribed, these services are accessible across various
          platforms, including PC, Mac, web, Android, and iOS devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering the feature set, it becomes apparent that ChatGPT Plus is
          well-suited for regular users and developers. In contrast, Copilot Pro
          is designed for business users, particularly those who interact with
          Office suites extensively in their daily workflows. The choice between
          these two premium AI chatbots ultimately depends on individual needs
          and usage scenarios.

          Realme founder and CEO Sky Li announced on social media that the
          company will soon launch the “Note” series of smartphones, positioned
          to compete with Xiaomi&apos;s popular Redmi Note lineup. Catering to
          demand for large-screen devices, the Realme Note series aims to
          provide affordable big-screen options for buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Realme currently offers the budget C series, mid-range numbered series
          and flagship GT series. The upcoming Note lineup is expected to slot
          between the regular number series and premium GT series.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to leaks, the first device Realme Note 1 will sport a
          6.67-inch 120Hz OLED display with FHD+ resolution and in-screen
          fingerprint scanner. It is tipped to be powered by the MediaTek
          Dimensity 7050 chipset. The triple camera setup may include a 108MP
          main camera, 8MP ultrawide lens and 2MP macro camera, plus a 16MP
          selfie camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Note 1 is said to pack a 5,000mAh battery with 67W fast charging
          support and stereo speakers. Going by the leaked specs versus Infinix
          Note 30 and Redmi Note 13, the Realme Note 1 could be priced
          attractively under Rs 20,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unclear when the Note 1 will launch and if the lineup will offer
          Pro/Pro+ models like Redmi Note series. Meanwhile, Realme just
          confirmed its 12 Pro series launch in India on January 29th.

        <p>
          With the Note series, Realme aims to capture the market for affordable
          big-screen smartphones, which is currently dominated by Xiaomi&apos;s
          Redmi Note. Realme&apos;s numbered series and GT series don&apos;t
          offer many low-cost large display options currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaked 6.67-inch screen size reveals Realme plans to compete
          head-on with Redmi Note in the budget big-screen segment. The OLED
          panel and 120Hz refresh rate also give it an edge over LCD displays of
          competing devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powered by a capable Dimensity 7050 chipset, the Note series will
          offer higher performance than Redmi&apos;s Snapdragon 4 Gen 1-based
          Note 13. The flagship-grade 108MP camera will also provide superior
          photography experience and lend premium appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced attractively under Rs 20,000, the Note series solves
          Realme&apos;s gap in affordable large-screen smartphones. It neatly
          slots between the premium GT and regular number series. With a
          value-for-money formula of good specs, big display and low price, it
          can shake up the budget smartphone landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Realme will need to ensure compelling differentiators beyond
          just large screens to stand out against Redmi&apos;s strong brand
          presence and familiar Note series. Smooth software, good battery life
          and appealing design will be key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the Note lineup indicates Realme&apos;s strategy of covering
          all price tiers and consumer needs. Alongside its budget C series,
          performance-centric GT models and all-rounder number series, the Note
          range helps Realme cement its &quot;value flagship&quot; appeal and
          take on rival Xiaomi more strongly across segments.

              auto-dimming IRVMs, and the updated i-SMART 2.0 connected car

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Despite no changes to exterior styling, the 2024 Astor&apos;s
              updates make it more in tune with user needs and preferences. The
              new wireless charging and enhanced voice controls cater perfectly
              to today&apos;s smartphone-centric users. Safety has also been
              augmented via auto-dimming IRVMs. And existing owners can enjoy
              these benefits via OTA software updates as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The midsize SUV space is ultra-competitive with models like
              Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, VW Taigun, Skoda Kushaq and Maruti
              Suzuki Grand Vitara. By injecting freshness via these new features
              rather than just superficial styling changes, MG has made the
              Astor more compelling in this crowded segment.

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              The 2024 Astor launch demonstrates MG Motor&apos;s
              customer-centric approach and long-term view of the Indian market.
              While other brands refresh models every 5 years or so, MG has
              updated the Astor in under 2 years of its launch highlighting its
              agility and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              MG entered India in 2019 with the Hector SUV that took the market
              by storm. The company has since expanded its portfolio to 5 models
              across the mass and premium segments, including the Astor,
              Gloster, ZS EV and MG One budget SUV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the pandemic and global volatility, MG has invested over
              Rs 3,500 crore in India - in manufacturing, R&D and networks. The
              carmaker employs over 2,000 people in India and provides indirect
              employment via its 450+ dealerships.
            </p>
            <p>
              By regularly injecting newness into products, MG is giving tough
              competition to established players. The updated Astor will appeal
              to existing owners through its added tech and value. For new
              buyers, its refreshed proposition makes it a serious contender
              among other options.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2024 Astor reiterates MG&apos;s dynamic approach and
              commitment to the Indian market. By responding quickly to user
              feedback and evolving needs, the company is building models that
              resonate strongly with customers. The updated Astor has the
              ingredients to boost MG&apos;s sales and market share further in
              2023.

          Artificial intelligence research company OpenAI has unveiled its new
          GPT Store, a marketplace specifically for personalized AI
          applications, as announced in the startup&apos;s blog on Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPT Store is integrated within OpenAI&apos;s wildly popular
          ChatGPT conversational chatbot. It allows users to explore and build
          customized GPTs, which are AI models trained for specific tasks like
          teaching math concepts or designing stickers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPT Store represents OpenAI&apos;s efforts to capitalize on
          ChatGPT&apos;s phenomenal consumer success in introducing the world to
          advanced generative AI capabilities last year. ChatGPT dazzled many
          with its human-like ability to generate written content, leading to
          exponential user growth, though engagement has slowed recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenAI stated that the GPT Store will initially only be available to
          paid ChatGPT subscribers over the next few months. Later, the company
          plans to add monetization features so GPT creators can potentially
          profit from their personalized AI models.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenAI first unveiled plans for the GPT Store back in November at its
          inaugural developer conference, with an intended launch by end of that
          month. However, in December, OpenAI chose to delay the launch to make
          more improvements based on user feedback regarding early GPT
          experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          This delay also followed internal turmoil surrounding the sudden
          removal and quick reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman by the board,
          after mass employee resignations were threatened in protest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Team on
          Wednesday. This is a paid enterprise version of ChatGPT that companies
          can use internally while keeping their data private and segregated.
          ChatGPT Team is priced between $25-$30 per user monthly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full public launch of the GPT Store represents the next phase in
          OpenAI&apos;s efforts to keep building on ChatGPT&apos;s enormous
          early success and deliver personalized AI to mainstream consumers and
          businesses.

        <p>
          The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is slated to launch on January 17 and is
          anticipated to be a benchmark in terms of features and specifications.
          Here&apos;s everything you need to know about Samsung&apos;s upcoming
          premium non-foldable flagship, which will be unveiled at Samsung
          Galaxy Unpacked 2024.
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-1.5">
          <span className="text-xl">Launch of &quot;Galaxy AI&quot;:</span>
          <p>
            In 2023, we saw firsthand the transformative potential of generative
            artificial intelligence (AI). Now, with the Galaxy S24 Ultra,
            Samsung is probably going to expand on these applications by
            integrating AI into the smartphone. Samsung is probably going to
            provide a couple more scenarios for the generative AI technology on
            devices. According to the leaks, Samsung is anticipated to provide
            features like real-time voice translation, an AI-powered wallpaper
            generator for simple customization, improved Bixby (at last), and
            optimized smartphone performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although some of these features are already present on devices like
            the Google Pixel 8, Samsung will democratize these features with the
            Galaxy S24 Ultra, making them more accessible to a wider audience.
            Thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, these operations will be
            carried out on-device, making them more private and secure than
            those of comparable cloud-based services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Samsung is implementing &quot;AI Zoom&quot; technology
            on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. With the S24 Ultra, the company appears to
            be combining the power of hardware, software, and AI to further
            elevate the zooming capability by cleverly reconstructing the
            subject using generative AI. The Ultra series of smartphones were
            already known for their zooming prowess. These are a few of the
            Samsung promotional videos that showcase the AI Zoom functionality
            of the upcoming Galaxy S24 Ultra.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s camera specs appear to be the same as
            those of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is rumored to
            come with a 200 MP primary camera, a 12 MP ultra-wide angle lens, a
            5x 50 MP periscope zoom lens, a 3x optical zoom lens, and a 12 MP

            high-resolution 50 MP sensor with 5x optical zoom and 10x lossless
            hybrid zoom, while the S23 Ultra has a 10 MP periscope zoom lens
            with 10x optical zoom. This is the only difference between the two
            generations of Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartphones.

            The Galaxy S24 Ultra is almost certainly powered by the Snapdragon 8
            Gen 3 SoC, one of the first Android smartphone processors with
            on-device generative AI capability, according to a post made by
            Qualcomm India on X (formerly Twitter). The Galaxy S24 Ultra is
            expected to change this, as although there are many phones on the
            market with the same chip, none of them fully take advantage of this
            new technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Samsung has a history of releasing new software features before
            Android; in fact, Google incorporates TouchWiz and Samsung OneUI
            design cues into the core of Android. Many such features are
            anticipated for this year. Yet another update, OneUI 6.1, which is
            based on Android 14, is anticipated to come pre-installed on the
            smartphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galaxy S24 Ultra may keep its 5,000 mAh battery that supports
            45W fast charging in addition to adding new Qi2 wireless charging
            support. This could mark the first time that a Galaxy device has
            MagSafe-like functionality.

            Despite having a similar appearance to its predecessors, the Samsung
            Galaxy S24 Ultra appears to have improved hardware and software,
            along with additional generative AI capabilities. Accordingly, the
            Galaxy S24 Ultra may very well be the priciest non-foldable
            smartphone that Samsung has ever released. As a result, we should
            anticipate that the price of the Samsung smartphone that isn&apos;t
            foldable will go above Rs 1,50,000.

          Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. anticipates lower revenue in the first
          quarter due to a prolonged decline in the market for consumer
          electronics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Taiwanese company, Foxconn, revealed a sharp 27% decline in
          December sales to NT$460.1 billion ($14.8 billion), raising further
          doubts about the momentum of the newest iPhone generation going into
          the new year.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the primary supplier of iPhone assembly to Apple Inc., Foxconn
          offers knowledge about the general demand for personal technology
          among consumers. When Apple&apos;s iPhone 15 first went on sale in
          September, it received mixed reviews in important markets. While sales
          in China fell, the US saw the device spark an upgrade cycle from
          previous iterations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The iPhone is expected to face significant challenges this year,
          particularly in China, where local tech giant Huawei Technologies Co.
          is regaining market share with its high-end Mate 60 phone and Chinese
          agencies and state-backed companies have expanded their ban on the
          device and other Apple hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, late last year, Foxconn became the focus of a regulatory
          probe in China that rattled investors&apos; cages and the confidence
          of foreign businesses doing business there. The Chinese competitor
          Luxshare Precision Industry Co., which plans to increase its iPhone
          production capacity through a recent acquisition, is another growing
          threat to Taiwan&apos;s device builder.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Liz Lee, associate director at Counterpoint Research, the
          volume of iPhone sales is expected to increase by 2% this year,
          falling short of the 5% growth of the mobile market as a whole. Sales
          of smartphones from Huawei, however, are predicted to increase by 37%.
          The lackluster demand for Apple&apos;s most recent iPhone led Barclays
          and Piper Sandler to lower their ratings of the company this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple provides Foxconn with the majority of its revenue. In 2023, its
          total sales were NT$6.16 trillion, a 7% decrease.

        Xiaomi has started releasing phones as of late 2024. A few weeks after
        its launch in China, the Redmi Note 13 series is now available
        everywhere. It appears that the company is eager to get its newest
        mid-range 5G phone in front of customers who are willing to pay less
        than Rs 35,000 for a phone. I had the opportunity to test-drive the
        Redmi Note 13 Pro+ beforehand, and this is my brief assessment of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <div className="space-y-1.5">
          <span className="text-xl">
            User&apos;s Swift Take on Redmi Note 13 Pro+
          </span>
          <div className="flex flex-col space-y-3">
            <span>
              The Redmi Note 13 Pro+&apos;s design is impressive, and I like
              that Xiaomi releases new models every time a new one comes out.
              Some companies in the market have been offering their signature
              design on the majority of their products because it helps them
              save money and improve brand recognition. Still, companies like
              Xiaomi constantly tweak their designs with a strong focus on
              aesthetics in an effort to win over customers.
            </span>
            <span>
              The glass body and metal frames of the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ give it
              a wonderful feel in the hand. After glancing at it, a few people
              even asked me which phone it was. Although there is a leather
              finish option that may provide a better grip on the device, the
              glass back panel is indeed a little slick. There is a coating on
              the back&apos;s upper side that functions somewhat like a mirror.
              In other words, the subject of your photo will have some idea of
              how you are posing them.
            </span>
            <span>
              Additionally, the gadget is not heavy at all, and I had no trouble
              using it with one hand. The Redmi Note 13 Pro+&apos;s button
              placement is ideal for me, and people who enjoy large, bright
              displays will find it enjoyable to use. Because of the
              device&apos;s slightly curved edges and thin bezels surrounding
              the screen, the display appears larger. The vibrant colors are
              appealing, and I appreciate that Xiaomi used premium Gorilla Glass
              Victus for increased durability. Additionally, at a lower price
              point, there is support for an IP68 water-resistant rating,
              something we have started to see on a few phones. The fact that
              the gadget won&apos;t be harmed during the wet season is
              fantastic.
            </span>
            <span>
              Because of the MediaTek Dimensity 7200-Ultra chipset, the Redmi
              Note 13 Pro+ felt incredibly smooth during the short time I had it
              in use. At the default settings, games such as Genshin Impact
              operated smoothly. As I continue to test it, we will discuss the
              performance aspect in our in-depth analysis. It&apos;s also true
              that the speakers sounded excellent. Dolby Atmos audio is only
              compatible with certain services, such as the Apple Music app.
            </span>
            <span>
              The software of the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ enhances the seamless
              performance as well. In place of the MIUI custom skin, the device
              comes with HyperOS, which is cleaner and less cluttered than what
              we have seen on previous models. The notification panel resembles
              that of iOS as well, but the user interface (UI) appears to be
              more user-friendly and fluid, and experience is what really
              counts.
            </span>
            <span>
              It&apos;s crucial to remember that HyperOS, according to Xiaomi,
              is a lightweight system made to facilitate seamless connections
              between Xiaomi users and their personal devices, automobiles, and
              smart home appliances rather than a redesigned version of MIUI.
              Basically, it&apos;s to create a single, integrated system out of
              all Xiaomi devices.
            </span>
            <span>
              We are unable to comment much about the smartphone&apos;s camera
              performance at this time because we are still testing it. All I
              can say is that the 200-megapixel camera mode can capture some
              excellent detailed photos, and the performance appears promising.
            </span>
            <span>
              With a 5,000mAh unit under the hood, long battery life is
              anticipated. The fast charger that Xiaomi is including in the
              package is a plus. We will verify the 120W charger&apos;s stated
              ability to fully charge a battery from empty to 100% in roughly 19
              minutes, as stated by the manufacturer.

          <span>
            With its features, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ appears to be a good
            all-around package and a promising device. Some fans of the Redmi
            Note series might find it difficult to accept that the company has
            produced a device that costs more than Rs 30,000 now that they have
            released the new version. Redmi has, however, also made sure that
            its new mid-range phone is powerful. With the Redmi Note 13 Pro+,
            you get almost all of the features you could anticipate from a
            device in its price range. All that remains to be seen is if this
            translates into effective performance in the practical setting. The
            device is expected to face competition from well-known phones under
            Rs 35,000, such as the OnePlus Nord 3 and iQOO Neo 7 Pro. The
            in-depth analysis of the most recent Redmi phone will be released
            soon, so be sure to check back with India Today Tech.

        Microsoft is preparing to add more AI-powered features to its next

        <br />
        <br />
        According to a report by Windows Central&apos;s Zac Bowden that cites
        anonymous sources, the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 will be
        powered by Qualcomm&apos;s newest Snapdragon X chips, while the
        Intel-powered models will be powered by the company&apos;s 14th
        generation processors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks to the new NPU chips, these upcoming PCs will be able to run the
        AI features that Microsoft plans to include in its next major Windows
        release. Reportedly, the hardware will also bring it up to speed with
        Apple silicon by greatly improving features like security and battery
        life.
        <br />
        <br />
        The report also includes details on the Surface Laptop 6, which will now
        have a 13.8-inch screen rather than a 13.5-inch screen and a rounded
        display with thinner bezels, similar to the Surface Pro 10. There might
        also be a touchpad with haptic feedback and a dedicated button for
        Microsoft Copilot, the business&apos;s AI-powered chatbot.
        <br />
        <br />
        There may be two USB-C ports, a Surface Connect port for charging, and a
        USB-A port for connectivity on the Surface Laptop 6. It&apos;s possible
        that the Surface Pro 10 will be released in the spring of 2024 and cost
        the same as its predecessor. Microsoft also intends to release an
        updated Surface Pro and a Surface Laptop Studio in 2025.

        Soon, the backups of your WhatsApp conversations will begin to use up
        storage space on your GDrive. Last month, the business revised its terms
        and conditions for Android devices, but it did not specify when the
        changes will take effect.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Verge, however, has reported that WhatsApp has already rolled out
        the updates to users on the app&apos;s beta version. This implies that
        regardless of whether a user is using the free or paid plan, WhatsApp
        backup—which includes chat history, photos, and videos—will now be
        counted against their GDrive storage. The messaging app owned by Meta
        further stated that all Android users of WhatsApp will be affected by
        the change in the first half of 2024 and that they will be informed
        thirty days in advance. The alert will appear as a banner in the
        app&apos;s &quot;Chat&quot; settings under &quot;Chat Backup.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        If you wish to transfer all of your app-related data to a new device but
        don&apos;t want to backup your WhatsApp chat on GDrive, you can use the
        built-in WhatsApp Chat Transfer tool. This tool doesn&apos;t need an
        active internet connection to function, but it does require both phones
        to be connected to the same Wi-Fi.
        <br />
        <br />
        The app has an option that lets you back up just text messages without
        images or videos, which will help you save a ton of space on GDrive if
        you still want to use it to back up your WhatsApp chats. For quite some
        time now, Android users have benefited from the fact that WhatsApp chat
        backups do not count against their GDrive storage space. However, iPhone
        users have not had the same luxury, as the tech giant only provides 5GB
        of cloud storage for free.

        Here we are in 2024. Instead of texting or sending pictures, consider
        sending stickers as a WhatsApp wish to your friends, family, and
        coworkers. Along with advice on how to make the most of WhatsApp&apos;s
        New Year-themed sticker messages, here are some of the best &quot;Happy
        New Year 2024&quot; stickers that are worth sharing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meta has launched a collection of over 17 animated stickers on WhatsApp
        featuring a unique New Year&apos;s 2024 theme. BUCK created the sticker
        set with the idea of &quot;ringing in 2024 with your favorite people
        near and far.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        To obtain the sticker pack for WhatsApp at no cost, click the emoji icon
        in the conversation window and then select the + icon. The sticker pack
        will download as a result. Moreover, you may utilize WhatsApp to create
        a sticker out of a customized picture.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can use WhatsApp Web to upload your favorite photo with a New
        Year&apos;s theme and utilize it to make a bespoke sticker. Once
        created, the sticker can be viewed on tablets, smartphones, and the
        WhatsApp website.
        <br />
        <br />
        To enhance your WhatsApp &quot;Happy New Year 2024&quot; wishes, think
        about using third-party sticker apps like Sticker.ly, which offer an
        abundance of New Year-themed sticker packs.

        14.52), as reported by 9to5Google.

        Unlike the &quot;Assistant Driving Mode Dashboard&quot; option, Google
        Maps&apos; Driving Mode is accessible after you begin driving
        navigation. It&apos;s easy to access thanks to the Assistant, Google
        Maps, and a launcher for compatible music, podcasts, audiobooks, and
        other streaming apps. It appears as a black bar at the bottom of the
        screen on the phone. An enhanced media user interface (UI) with large
        touch targets is displayed in this mode.

        Speaking of it&apos;s impact on users - Google announced in 2022 that it
        would be focusing on Maps Driving Mode. The company discovered that most
        users preferred this method over the Dashboard. Instead, Google may
        recommend that users use &quot;Hey Google, launch driving mode&quot; to
        access the Google Maps navigation mode. In June, this feature was
        updated to allow Assistant to enable faster voice input.

        compliance show-cause notices from Financial Intelligence Unit-India,
        part of the Indian Finance Ministry, and have been instructed to block
