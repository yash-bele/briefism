          On Tuesday, Jio revealed a time-limited annual prepaid recharge plan
          accompanied by a Republic Day offer. Priced at Rs 2,999, this prepaid
          plan encompasses 2.5 GB of 4G data and unlimited 5G data for a
          duration of 365 days, coupled with unrestricted calling. Beyond these

          Swiggy and Ajio coupons, flight discounts through Ixigo, and a 10%
          reduction on specific products at Reliance Digital.
        </p>
        <p>
          This recharge plan, averaging a monthly cost of Rs 230, will be
          accessible through the My Jio app from January 15 to January 30. Users
          availing of this plan during this period are entitled to a range of
          benefits. While not an entirely new plan, Jio sweetens the deal with
          additional advantages as part of the Republic Day offer, extending
          beyond the typical offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Complementary benefits encompass 100 SMS per day and a basic
          subscription to JioCinema.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the Republic Day offer, Jio introduces a 10% discount for the
          purchase of select items at Reliance Digital. For eligibility, the
          minimum purchase value should exceed Rs 5,000, and the maximum
          discount is capped at Rs 10,000. This translates to a flat Rs 10,000
          discount on a gadget valued at Rs 1,00,000 or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further incentives include two Swiggy coupons, each valued at Rs 125,
          applicable to orders exceeding Rs 299. Additionally, Jio presents an
          Ixigo coupon, facilitating reductions of Rs 1,500 for three
          passengers, Rs 1,000 for two passengers, and Rs 500 for a single
          ticket on flight bookings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of Jio&apos;s Republic Day promotion, users can benefit from a
          flat Rs 500 discount coupon for Ajio, redeemable on purchases
          exceeding Rs 2,499. Lastly, the plan encompasses a 30% discount on
          select Tira products valued over Rs 999, with the discount capped at
          Rs 1,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jio also extends its annual recharge offerings with plans priced at Rs
          3,662, Rs 3,226, Rs 3,225, Rs 3,227, and Rs 3,178, each bundled with

          Microsoft has expanded the availability of Copilot Pro beyond
          enterprises, making it accessible for individuals. This move,
          announced on Tuesday, positions Copilot Pro as a competitor to ChatGPT
          Plus, the premium version of ChatGPT, offering enhanced response times
          and access to cutting-edge models like GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced at Rs 2,000 per month, Copilot Pro is in close competition with
          ChatGPT Plus, available at Rs 1,950 per month. With a minimal price
          difference, these premium AI-driven chatbots target power users
          seeking top-notch AI capabilities. Let&apos;s delve into an analysis
          of these two offerings and how they stack up against each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft collaborates closely with OpenAI, and Copilot is powered by
          the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model, which is the same
          underlying technology that drives ChatGPT. Consequently, the results
          and responses from both chatbots are comparable. Both Copilot Pro and
          ChatGPT Plus provide access to the latest GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo
          models.
        </p>
        <p>
          While both subscriptions offer similar features, ChatGPT Plus has a
          unique advantage—the GPT Store. This store contains over three million
          customized versions of ChatGPT tailored for specific use cases.
          Microsoft has indicated that Copilot Pro users will eventually have
          the capability to create their own GPT, although this feature will be
          added later.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the flip side, Copilot Pro presents an advantage over ChatGPT Plus,
          especially for Microsoft 365 subscribers. Copilot Pro enhances
          applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and OneNote with
          generative AI capabilities. This integration enables users to quickly
          create summaries on Word, generate presentations on PowerPoint, and
          draft AI-assisted emails in Outlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both ChatGPT Plus and Copilot Pro allow users to generate images using
          DALL-E, with a limit of up to 100 images per day. Additionally, both
          models provide priority access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo during peak
          times. Once subscribed, these services are accessible across various
          platforms, including PC, Mac, web, Android, and iOS devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering the feature set, it becomes apparent that ChatGPT Plus is
          well-suited for regular users and developers. In contrast, Copilot Pro
          is designed for business users, particularly those who interact with
          Office suites extensively in their daily workflows. The choice between
          these two premium AI chatbots ultimately depends on individual needs
          and usage scenarios.

              Motorola has recently introduced the G34, a budget-friendly phone
              equipped with the Snapdragon 695, a mid-range chipset commonly
              found in phones like the OnePlus CE 3 Lite and Poco X5. Operating
              on near-stock Android 14 with a few customizations, the Motorola
              G34 boasts a slightly smaller 6.5-inch LCD screen with a high
              refresh rate. It features a decent 50MP primary camera supported
              by another 2MP sensor. Priced starting at Rs 10,999, the Motorola
              G34 is a cost-effective choice.

              The Poco M6 stands out as another budget-friendly 5G phone
              excelling in various aspects. Powered by the Dimensity 6100+ chip,
              the phone offers a sizable 6.74-inch LCD screen and a 50MP camera
              delivering decent daytime photos. For those seeking a

              a clean and smooth user interface, the Nord CE 3 Lite, starting

        </p>
        <p>
          Realme currently offers the budget C series, mid-range numbered series
          and flagship GT series. The upcoming Note lineup is expected to slot
          between the regular number series and premium GT series.
        </p>

          According to leaks, the first device Realme Note 1 will sport a
          6.67-inch 120Hz OLED display with FHD+ resolution and in-screen
          fingerprint scanner. It is tipped to be powered by the MediaTek
          Dimensity 7050 chipset. The triple camera setup may include a 108MP

          selfie camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Note 1 is said to pack a 5,000mAh battery with 67W fast charging
          support and stereo speakers. Going by the leaked specs versus Infinix
          Note 30 and Redmi Note 13, the Realme Note 1 could be priced
          attractively under Rs 20,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unclear when the Note 1 will launch and if the lineup will offer
          Pro/Pro+ models like Redmi Note series. Meanwhile, Realme just

          With the Note series, Realme aims to capture the market for affordable
          big-screen smartphones, which is currently dominated by Xiaomi&apos;s
          Redmi Note. Realme&apos;s numbered series and GT series don&apos;t
          offer many low-cost large display options currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaked 6.67-inch screen size reveals Realme plans to compete
          head-on with Redmi Note in the budget big-screen segment. The OLED
          panel and 120Hz refresh rate also give it an edge over LCD displays of
          competing devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powered by a capable Dimensity 7050 chipset, the Note series will
          offer higher performance than Redmi&apos;s Snapdragon 4 Gen 1-based
          Note 13. The flagship-grade 108MP camera will also provide superior
          photography experience and lend premium appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced attractively under Rs 20,000, the Note series solves
          Realme&apos;s gap in affordable large-screen smartphones. It neatly
          slots between the premium GT and regular number series. With a
          value-for-money formula of good specs, big display and low price, it
          can shake up the budget smartphone landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Realme will need to ensure compelling differentiators beyond
          just large screens to stand out against Redmi&apos;s strong brand
          presence and familiar Note series. Smooth software, good battery life
          and appealing design will be key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the Note lineup indicates Realme&apos;s strategy of covering
          all price tiers and consumer needs. Alongside its budget C series,
          performance-centric GT models and all-rounder number series, the Note
          range helps Realme cement its &quot;value flagship&quot; appeal and
          take on rival Xiaomi more strongly across segments.

            <p>
              Despite no changes to exterior styling, the 2024 Astor&apos;s
              updates make it more in tune with user needs and preferences. The
              new wireless charging and enhanced voice controls cater perfectly
              to today&apos;s smartphone-centric users. Safety has also been
              augmented via auto-dimming IRVMs. And existing owners can enjoy
              these benefits via OTA software updates as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The midsize SUV space is ultra-competitive with models like
              Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, VW Taigun, Skoda Kushaq and Maruti
              Suzuki Grand Vitara. By injecting freshness via these new features
              rather than just superficial styling changes, MG has made the
              Astor more compelling in this crowded segment.

              The 2024 Astor launch demonstrates MG Motor&apos;s
              customer-centric approach and long-term view of the Indian market.
              While other brands refresh models every 5 years or so, MG has
              updated the Astor in under 2 years of its launch highlighting its
              agility and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              MG entered India in 2019 with the Hector SUV that took the market
              by storm. The company has since expanded its portfolio to 5 models
              across the mass and premium segments, including the Astor,
              Gloster, ZS EV and MG One budget SUV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the pandemic and global volatility, MG has invested over
              Rs 3,500 crore in India - in manufacturing, R&D and networks. The
              carmaker employs over 2,000 people in India and provides indirect
              employment via its 450+ dealerships.
            </p>
            <p>
              By regularly injecting newness into products, MG is giving tough
              competition to established players. The updated Astor will appeal
              to existing owners through its added tech and value. For new
              buyers, its refreshed proposition makes it a serious contender
              among other options.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2024 Astor reiterates MG&apos;s dynamic approach and
              commitment to the Indian market. By responding quickly to user
              feedback and evolving needs, the company is building models that
              resonate strongly with customers. The updated Astor has the
              ingredients to boost MG&apos;s sales and market share further in
              2023.

        <p>
          Artificial intelligence research company OpenAI has unveiled its new
          GPT Store, a marketplace specifically for personalized AI
          applications, as announced in the startup&apos;s blog on Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPT Store is integrated within OpenAI&apos;s wildly popular
          ChatGPT conversational chatbot. It allows users to explore and build
          customized GPTs, which are AI models trained for specific tasks like
          teaching math concepts or designing stickers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPT Store represents OpenAI&apos;s efforts to capitalize on
          ChatGPT&apos;s phenomenal consumer success in introducing the world to
          advanced generative AI capabilities last year. ChatGPT dazzled many
          with its human-like ability to generate written content, leading to
          exponential user growth, though engagement has slowed recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenAI stated that the GPT Store will initially only be available to
          paid ChatGPT subscribers over the next few months. Later, the company
          plans to add monetization features so GPT creators can potentially
          profit from their personalized AI models.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenAI first unveiled plans for the GPT Store back in November at its
          inaugural developer conference, with an intended launch by end of that
          month. However, in December, OpenAI chose to delay the launch to make
          more improvements based on user feedback regarding early GPT
          experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          This delay also followed internal turmoil surrounding the sudden
          removal and quick reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman by the board,
          after mass employee resignations were threatened in protest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Team on
          Wednesday. This is a paid enterprise version of ChatGPT that companies
          can use internally while keeping their data private and segregated.
          ChatGPT Team is priced between $25-$30 per user monthly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full public launch of the GPT Store represents the next phase in
          OpenAI&apos;s efforts to keep building on ChatGPT&apos;s enormous
          early success and deliver personalized AI to mainstream consumers and
          businesses.

          Apple is reportedly preparing to reveal ground-breaking generative
          AI-based tools for its coveted iPhone series at the Worldwide
          Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024, which is scheduled for June, in a
          tech race against its rivals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the observations made by Mark Gurman, the tech expert at
          Bloomberg, in his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter (via mysmartprice),
          the upcoming iOS 18 update from Apple is expected to bring in a new
          era of artificial intelligence by introducing a number of cutting-edge
          features that are intended to improve user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anticipated artificial intelligence features might comprise
          auto-summarization, which enables users to condense lengthy content,
          and an auto-complete feature for applications, which streamlines user
          interactions. Additionally, it is rumored that Apple will incorporate
          AI into Apple Music, offering a more customized and user-friendly
          music streaming experience. The report also suggests that new AI-based
          developer tools will be released, giving creators more opportunities
          to innovate inside the Apple ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Gurman, since early 2023, Apple has been working hard to
          develop a proprietary Large Language Model (LLM) called Ajax. This
          cutting-edge model seeks to integrate AI capabilities into
          Apple&quot;s flagship devices, including iPhones and Macs. When it
          comes to incorporating AI into services like Siri, Apple Music,
          essential apps, and more, the LLM will be essential. But it&quot;s
          anticipated that Apple will proceed cautiously and choose to release
          these features gradually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gurman predicts that Apple&quot;s AI vision will be fully realized by
          2025, indicating that the tech giant has a visionary roadmap that goes
          beyond 2024. This ambitious timeline highlights Apple&quot;s
          dedication to the methodical and meticulous integration of new
          technologies, even though it suggests that not all AI-centric
          announcements will materialize in the upcoming year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond advancements in AI, Gurman offers insight into Apple&quot;s
          more comprehensive product plan. The highly anticipated mixed reality
          headset, the Apple Vision Pro, is expected to be released in February.
          It is reported that new iPad Pro models with OLED screens and the
          potent M3 SoC will go on sale in March. There may also be a larger
          12.9-inch iPad Air release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Gurman claims that a revised Apple TV 4K with a new
          chipset may hit the market in the first half of 2024.

          The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is slated to launch on January 17 and is
          anticipated to be a benchmark in terms of features and specifications.
          Here&apos;s everything you need to know about Samsung&apos;s upcoming
          premium non-foldable flagship, which will be unveiled at Samsung
          Galaxy Unpacked 2024.

          <p>
            In 2023, we saw firsthand the transformative potential of generative
            artificial intelligence (AI). Now, with the Galaxy S24 Ultra,
            Samsung is probably going to expand on these applications by
            integrating AI into the smartphone. Samsung is probably going to
            provide a couple more scenarios for the generative AI technology on
            devices. According to the leaks, Samsung is anticipated to provide
            features like real-time voice translation, an AI-powered wallpaper
            generator for simple customization, improved Bixby (at last), and
            optimized smartphone performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although some of these features are already present on devices like
            the Google Pixel 8, Samsung will democratize these features with the
            Galaxy S24 Ultra, making them more accessible to a wider audience.
            Thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, these operations will be
            carried out on-device, making them more private and secure than
            those of comparable cloud-based services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Samsung is implementing &quot;AI Zoom&quot; technology
            on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. With the S24 Ultra, the company appears to
            be combining the power of hardware, software, and AI to further
            elevate the zooming capability by cleverly reconstructing the
            subject using generative AI. The Ultra series of smartphones were
            already known for their zooming prowess. These are a few of the
            Samsung promotional videos that showcase the AI Zoom functionality
            of the upcoming Galaxy S24 Ultra.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s camera specs appear to be the same as
            those of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is rumored to
            come with a 200 MP primary camera, a 12 MP ultra-wide angle lens, a
            5x 50 MP periscope zoom lens, a 3x optical zoom lens, and a 12 MP
            selfie camera. The upcoming Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartphone has a
            high-resolution 50 MP sensor with 5x optical zoom and 10x lossless
            hybrid zoom, while the S23 Ultra has a 10 MP periscope zoom lens
            with 10x optical zoom. This is the only difference between the two
            generations of Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartphones.

            The Galaxy S24 Ultra is almost certainly powered by the Snapdragon 8
            Gen 3 SoC, one of the first Android smartphone processors with
            on-device generative AI capability, according to a post made by
            Qualcomm India on X (formerly Twitter). The Galaxy S24 Ultra is
            expected to change this, as although there are many phones on the
            market with the same chip, none of them fully take advantage of this
            new technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Samsung has a history of releasing new software features before
            Android; in fact, Google incorporates TouchWiz and Samsung OneUI
            design cues into the core of Android. Many such features are
            anticipated for this year. Yet another update, OneUI 6.1, which is
            based on Android 14, is anticipated to come pre-installed on the
            smartphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galaxy S24 Ultra may keep its 5,000 mAh battery that supports
            45W fast charging in addition to adding new Qi2 wireless charging
            support. This could mark the first time that a Galaxy device has
            MagSafe-like functionality.

            Despite having a similar appearance to its predecessors, the Samsung
            Galaxy S24 Ultra appears to have improved hardware and software,
            along with additional generative AI capabilities. Accordingly, the
            Galaxy S24 Ultra may very well be the priciest non-foldable
            smartphone that Samsung has ever released. As a result, we should
            anticipate that the price of the Samsung smartphone that isn&apos;t
            foldable will go above Rs 1,50,000.

          Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. anticipates lower revenue in the first
          quarter due to a prolonged decline in the market for consumer
          electronics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Taiwanese company, Foxconn, revealed a sharp 27% decline in
          December sales to NT$460.1 billion ($14.8 billion), raising further
          doubts about the momentum of the newest iPhone generation going into
          the new year.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the primary supplier of iPhone assembly to Apple Inc., Foxconn
          offers knowledge about the general demand for personal technology
          among consumers. When Apple&apos;s iPhone 15 first went on sale in
          September, it received mixed reviews in important markets. While sales
          in China fell, the US saw the device spark an upgrade cycle from
          previous iterations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The iPhone is expected to face significant challenges this year,
          particularly in China, where local tech giant Huawei Technologies Co.
          is regaining market share with its high-end Mate 60 phone and Chinese
          agencies and state-backed companies have expanded their ban on the
          device and other Apple hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, late last year, Foxconn became the focus of a regulatory
          probe in China that rattled investors&apos; cages and the confidence
          of foreign businesses doing business there. The Chinese competitor
          Luxshare Precision Industry Co., which plans to increase its iPhone
          production capacity through a recent acquisition, is another growing
          threat to Taiwan&apos;s device builder.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Liz Lee, associate director at Counterpoint Research, the
          volume of iPhone sales is expected to increase by 2% this year,
          falling short of the 5% growth of the mobile market as a whole. Sales
          of smartphones from Huawei, however, are predicted to increase by 37%.
          The lackluster demand for Apple&apos;s most recent iPhone led Barclays
          and Piper Sandler to lower their ratings of the company this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple provides Foxconn with the majority of its revenue. In 2023, its
          total sales were NT$6.16 trillion, a 7% decrease.

        Xiaomi has started releasing phones as of late 2024. A few weeks after
        its launch in China, the Redmi Note 13 series is now available
        everywhere. It appears that the company is eager to get its newest
        mid-range 5G phone in front of customers who are willing to pay less
        than Rs 35,000 for a phone. I had the opportunity to test-drive the
        Redmi Note 13 Pro+ beforehand, and this is my brief assessment of it.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <div className="space-y-1.5">
          <span className="text-xl">
            User&apos;s Swift Take on Redmi Note 13 Pro+
          </span>
          <div className="flex flex-col space-y-3">
            <span>
              The Redmi Note 13 Pro+&apos;s design is impressive, and I like
              that Xiaomi releases new models every time a new one comes out.
              Some companies in the market have been offering their signature
              design on the majority of their products because it helps them
              save money and improve brand recognition. Still, companies like
              Xiaomi constantly tweak their designs with a strong focus on
              aesthetics in an effort to win over customers.
            </span>
            <span>
              The glass body and metal frames of the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ give it
              a wonderful feel in the hand. After glancing at it, a few people
              even asked me which phone it was. Although there is a leather
              finish option that may provide a better grip on the device, the
              glass back panel is indeed a little slick. There is a coating on
              the back&apos;s upper side that functions somewhat like a mirror.
              In other words, the subject of your photo will have some idea of
              how you are posing them.
            </span>
            <span>
              Additionally, the gadget is not heavy at all, and I had no trouble
              using it with one hand. The Redmi Note 13 Pro+&apos;s button
              placement is ideal for me, and people who enjoy large, bright
              displays will find it enjoyable to use. Because of the
              device&apos;s slightly curved edges and thin bezels surrounding
              the screen, the display appears larger. The vibrant colors are
              appealing, and I appreciate that Xiaomi used premium Gorilla Glass
              Victus for increased durability. Additionally, at a lower price
              point, there is support for an IP68 water-resistant rating,
              something we have started to see on a few phones. The fact that
              the gadget won&apos;t be harmed during the wet season is
              fantastic.
            </span>
            <span>
              Because of the MediaTek Dimensity 7200-Ultra chipset, the Redmi
              Note 13 Pro+ felt incredibly smooth during the short time I had it
              in use. At the default settings, games such as Genshin Impact
              operated smoothly. As I continue to test it, we will discuss the
              performance aspect in our in-depth analysis. It&apos;s also true
              that the speakers sounded excellent. Dolby Atmos audio is only
              compatible with certain services, such as the Apple Music app.
            </span>
            <span>
              The software of the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ enhances the seamless
              performance as well. In place of the MIUI custom skin, the device
              comes with HyperOS, which is cleaner and less cluttered than what
              we have seen on previous models. The notification panel resembles
              that of iOS as well, but the user interface (UI) appears to be
              more user-friendly and fluid, and experience is what really
              counts.
            </span>
            <span>
              It&apos;s crucial to remember that HyperOS, according to Xiaomi,
              is a lightweight system made to facilitate seamless connections
              between Xiaomi users and their personal devices, automobiles, and
              smart home appliances rather than a redesigned version of MIUI.
              Basically, it&apos;s to create a single, integrated system out of
              all Xiaomi devices.
            </span>
            <span>
              We are unable to comment much about the smartphone&apos;s camera
              performance at this time because we are still testing it. All I
              can say is that the 200-megapixel camera mode can capture some
              excellent detailed photos, and the performance appears promising.
            </span>
            <span>
              With a 5,000mAh unit under the hood, long battery life is
              anticipated. The fast charger that Xiaomi is including in the
              package is a plus. We will verify the 120W charger&apos;s stated
              ability to fully charge a battery from empty to 100% in roughly 19
              minutes, as stated by the manufacturer.

          <span>
            With its features, the Redmi Note 13 Pro+ appears to be a good
            all-around package and a promising device. Some fans of the Redmi
            Note series might find it difficult to accept that the company has
            produced a device that costs more than Rs 30,000 now that they have
            released the new version. Redmi has, however, also made sure that
            its new mid-range phone is powerful. With the Redmi Note 13 Pro+,
            you get almost all of the features you could anticipate from a
            device in its price range. All that remains to be seen is if this
            translates into effective performance in the practical setting. The
            device is expected to face competition from well-known phones under
            Rs 35,000, such as the OnePlus Nord 3 and iQOO Neo 7 Pro. The
            in-depth analysis of the most recent Redmi phone will be released
            soon, so be sure to check back with India Today Tech.

        Microsoft is preparing to add more AI-powered features to its next

        CADMUS, are anticipated to be powered by a next-generation neural

        <br />
        <br />
        According to a report by Windows Central&apos;s Zac Bowden that cites
        anonymous sources, the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 will be
        powered by Qualcomm&apos;s newest Snapdragon X chips, while the
        Intel-powered models will be powered by the company&apos;s 14th
        generation processors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks to the new NPU chips, these upcoming PCs will be able to run the
        AI features that Microsoft plans to include in its next major Windows
        release. Reportedly, the hardware will also bring it up to speed with
        Apple silicon by greatly improving features like security and battery
        life.
        <br />
        <br />
        The report also includes details on the Surface Laptop 6, which will now
        have a 13.8-inch screen rather than a 13.5-inch screen and a rounded
        display with thinner bezels, similar to the Surface Pro 10. There might
        also be a touchpad with haptic feedback and a dedicated button for
        Microsoft Copilot, the business&apos;s AI-powered chatbot.
        <br />
        <br />
        There may be two USB-C ports, a Surface Connect port for charging, and a
        USB-A port for connectivity on the Surface Laptop 6. It&apos;s possible
        that the Surface Pro 10 will be released in the spring of 2024 and cost
        the same as its predecessor. Microsoft also intends to release an
        updated Surface Pro and a Surface Laptop Studio in 2025.

        Soon, the backups of your WhatsApp conversations will begin to use up
        storage space on your GDrive. Last month, the business revised its terms
        and conditions for Android devices, but it did not specify when the
        changes will take effect.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Verge, however, has reported that WhatsApp has already rolled out
        the updates to users on the app&apos;s beta version. This implies that
        regardless of whether a user is using the free or paid plan, WhatsApp
        backup—which includes chat history, photos, and videos—will now be
        counted against their GDrive storage. The messaging app owned by Meta
        further stated that all Android users of WhatsApp will be affected by
        the change in the first half of 2024 and that they will be informed
        thirty days in advance. The alert will appear as a banner in the
        app&apos;s &quot;Chat&quot; settings under &quot;Chat Backup.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        If you wish to transfer all of your app-related data to a new device but
        don&apos;t want to backup your WhatsApp chat on GDrive, you can use the
        built-in WhatsApp Chat Transfer tool. This tool doesn&apos;t need an
        active internet connection to function, but it does require both phones
        to be connected to the same Wi-Fi.
        <br />
        <br />
        The app has an option that lets you back up just text messages without
        images or videos, which will help you save a ton of space on GDrive if
        you still want to use it to back up your WhatsApp chats. For quite some
        time now, Android users have benefited from the fact that WhatsApp chat
        backups do not count against their GDrive storage space. However, iPhone
        users have not had the same luxury, as the tech giant only provides 5GB
        of cloud storage for free.

        Here we are in 2024. Instead of texting or sending pictures, consider
        sending stickers as a WhatsApp wish to your friends, family, and
        coworkers. Along with advice on how to make the most of WhatsApp&apos;s
        New Year-themed sticker messages, here are some of the best &quot;Happy
        New Year 2024&quot; stickers that are worth sharing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meta has launched a collection of over 17 animated stickers on WhatsApp
        featuring a unique New Year&apos;s 2024 theme. BUCK created the sticker
        set with the idea of &quot;ringing in 2024 with your favorite people
        near and far.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        To obtain the sticker pack for WhatsApp at no cost, click the emoji icon
        in the conversation window and then select the + icon. The sticker pack
        will download as a result. Moreover, you may utilize WhatsApp to create
        a sticker out of a customized picture.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can use WhatsApp Web to upload your favorite photo with a New
        Year&apos;s theme and utilize it to make a bespoke sticker. Once
        created, the sticker can be viewed on tablets, smartphones, and the
        WhatsApp website.
        <br />
        <br />
        To enhance your WhatsApp &quot;Happy New Year 2024&quot; wishes, think
        about using third-party sticker apps like Sticker.ly, which offer an
        abundance of New Year-themed sticker packs.

        Google Maps will be discontinued in February 2024, according to code
        strings discovered in the most recent version of the Google app (version
        14.52), as reported by 9to5Google.

        Unlike the &quot;Assistant Driving Mode Dashboard&quot; option, Google
        Maps&apos; Driving Mode is accessible after you begin driving
        navigation. It&apos;s easy to access thanks to the Assistant, Google
        Maps, and a launcher for compatible music, podcasts, audiobooks, and
        other streaming apps. It appears as a black bar at the bottom of the
        screen on the phone. An enhanced media user interface (UI) with large
        touch targets is displayed in this mode.

        Speaking of it&apos;s impact on users - Google announced in 2022 that it
        would be focusing on Maps Driving Mode. The company discovered that most
        users preferred this method over the Dashboard. Instead, Google may
        recommend that users use &quot;Hey Google, launch driving mode&quot; to
        access the Google Maps navigation mode. In June, this feature was
        updated to allow Assistant to enable faster voice input.

        compliance show-cause notices from Financial Intelligence Unit-India,
        part of the Indian Finance Ministry, and have been instructed to block

        operations within the nation and disregard for the local money
        laundering regulations, these companies have received notice.
