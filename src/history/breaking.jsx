        A series of strong earthquakes struck Japan on Monday, causing tsunami
        waves to rise as high as five feet. Local media reported that in
        response, authorities sent out evacuation advisories and tsunami
        warnings to people living along the nation&apos;s northwest coast.
        <br />
        <br />
        The earthquake affected Ishikawa and its surrounding prefectures,
        according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), with one prefecture
        recording an initial magnitude of 7.6, as reported by The Associated
        Press. Following the earthquake, local weather agencies predicted that
        there would be tsunami waves within 300 kilometers of the Noto,
        Ishigawa, epicenter.
        <br />
        <br />
        At 4:06 PM local time, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake sparked the seismic
        activity. Subsequently, at 4:10 PM, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake, at 4:18
        PM, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake, at 4:23 PM local time, a 4.5 magnitude
        event, at 4:29 PM local time, and at 4:32 PM local time, a 4.6 magnitude
        earthquake.
        <br />
        <br />
        People facing a tsunami of more than one meter in height were
        &quot;highly likely to be unable to stand, with the possibility of
        death&quot;, according to a warning issued by the Japan Meteorological
        Agency (JMA), as reported by The Japan Times. The Japan Meteorological
        Agency (JMA) issued tsunami warnings along the western coasts of the
        prefectures of Ishikawa, Niigata, and Toyama, according to Reuters.
        According to NHK, waves in other prefectures such as Niigata and Toyama
        reached three meters in height.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many videos that have been going viral on social media show individuals
        being forced to shelter under tables and chairs as buildings tremble
        violently. Meanwhile powerful tsunami waves posed an immediate threat to
        coastal areas. The earthquake activity caused severe damage to
        surrounding roadways and fractures in them, resulting in the collapse of
        numerous dwellings.

        According to INSACOG&apos;s data updated on Monday, 196 cases of
        COVID-19 sub-variant JN.1 have been found in the country to date, with
        Odisha entering the list of states that have detected the variant&apos;s
        presence.
        <br />
        <br />
        The JN.1 sub-variant of the virus has been found in ten states and Union
        territories thus far. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium
        (INSACOG) lists these states as follows: Kerala (83), Goa (51), Gujarat
        (34), Karnataka (eight), Maharashtra (seven), Rajasthan (five), Tamil
        Nadu (four), Telangana (two), Odisha (one), and Delhi (one).
        <br />
        <br />
        According to INSACOG data, JN.1 was found in 179 out of the 179 Covid
        cases that were reported nationwide in December; the remaining 17 cases
        had this detection in November. Despite its fast spreading nature, the
        World Health Organization (WHO) has designated JN.1 as a distinct
        &quot;variant of interest&quot; and stated that it presents a
        &quot;low&quot; danger to global public health.
        <br />
        <br />
        The international body stated that the JN.1 sub-variant of the
        coronavirus was previously categorized as a variation of interest (VOI)
        as a component of the parent lineage that is categorized as a VOI, the
        BA.2.86 sub-lineages. Nonetheless, JN.1 cases have been recorded from
        several nations in recent weeks, and the virus&apos;s incidence has
        risen sharply worldwide.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to an increase in Covid cases and the discovery of the JN.1
        sub-variant in the nation, the Center has requested that the states and
        Union territories keep a continuous watch. India now has 636 new
        coronavirus infections, while there are 4,394 ongoing cases, according
        to data released on Monday by the Health ministry.

        Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the brutal murder of Punjabi
        singer Sidhu Moosewala, was on Monday declared a designated terrorist by
        the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).
        <br />
        <br />
        A key member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Brar had claimed
        responsibility for the murder of Moosewala, who was killed in a hail of
        bullets in Punjab&apos;s Mansa district on May 29, 2022. A native of
        Faridkot in Punjab, Brar, whose real name is Satinderjit Singh, went to
        Canada on a student visa in 2017.
        <br />
        <br />
        While claiming responsibility for Mooosewala&apos;s murder, Brar had
        said in a Facebook post, “Sachin Bishnoi Dhattaranwali, Lawrence
        Bishnoi, and I are behind the killing of Sidhu Moosewala.” The gangster
        had claimed that he killed Moosewala to avenge the death of Youth Akali
        Dal leader Vicky Middukhera.
        <br />
        <br />
        Brar had also claimed responsibility for the murder of Dera follower
        Pardeep Singh Kataria in Kotkapura in 2022. An accused in the 2015
        Bargari sacrilege case, Kataria was out on bail and was shot dead at his
        shop by a group of six men on November 11 that year. Brar is also
        allegedly involved in an extortion racket being run in Punjab and is
        believed to have had a hand in the murder of Youth Congress leader
        Gurlal Pehalwan.

        After a 21-minute flight, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
        launched the X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat), its first polarimetry
        mission, into an exact circular orbit of 650 km on Monday morning,
        January 1.
        <br />
        <br />
        The second satellite-based mission in the world devoted to measuring
        X-ray polarimetry is known as XPoSat. India&apos;s first mission to
        analyze the polarization of X-rays emitted from bright celestial sources
        in the medium frequency band is called X-ray Polarimeter Satellite
        (XPoSat). Indian X-ray Polarimeter (POLIX) and X-ray Spectroscopy and
        Timing (XSPECT) are the two payloads that make up XPoSat. The Raman
        Research Institute and the UR Rao Satellite Centre, both in Bengaluru,
        are the organizations that constructed them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Low earth orbit (about 650 km, with a low inclination of about 6
        degrees) is the designated observational orbit for the spacecraft.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the course of its projected five-year mission, XPoSat will observe
        sources that produce polarized X-rays. The observations will take place,
        for example, during the eclipse period, when the magnetars, also known
        as neutron stars, are passing through the Earth&apos;s shadow. These
        stars are extremely magnetic and exhibit a wide range of X-ray activity.

        We should anticipate an even greater level of artificial intelligence
        being incorporated into our daily lives. It might end up in everything,
        including laptops and cellphones, and be used to personalize webpages
        and devices to each user&apos;s specifications.
        <br />
        <br />
        Visualize artificial intelligence (AI) as a being that exists solely on
        the knowledge that humans have accumulated over thousands of years. This
        is a technology that is all-pervasive and will soon become commonplace.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is the most advanced technology ever developed, and it gets
        stronger every second. Because of this, the past year has been
        extraordinary; never before have technological advancements and
        everything related to them changed so swiftly that it is now challenging
        to predict our future.
