        <p>
          Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, is poised for an elevation
          within the royal family to a pivotal role in King Charles III’s
          restructured monarchy. According to reports, the mother of three could
          be granted new powers by the King after celebrating her 42nd birthday
          recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mail reported that Kate will mark her birthday privately in
          Windsor with husband Prince William and their children George,
          Charlotte and Louis, before returning to school. But soon, she is
          expected to be promoted as per a source.
        </p>
        <p>
          King Charles is said to be considering appointing Kate as a Royal Lady
          of the Order of the Garter. This is regarded as Britain&apos;s most
          senior chivalric order, with members personally chosen by the monarch.
          Prince William, Camilla, Princess Anne and Prince Edward already
          belong to the Order of the Garter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If inducted, Kate would gain the authority to grant royal warrants,
          similar to Camilla and William. Granting royal warrants allows firms
          to use the Royal Arms in branding and supply the royal household. This
          power was previously held by King Charles as Prince of Wales,
          bequeathed by the late Queen Elizabeth II.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Charles retains the power for now, he may eventually grant it to
          Camilla and William too. But some royal warrant holders believe Kate
          officially endorsing brands would provide a huge boost to British
          industry, driving fashion and lifestyle interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a working member of the royal family, Kate has grown into her roles
          over the years. She has focused on early childhood development,
          promoting sports and outdoor activities. Along with William, Kate has
          also advocated for mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, she played piano publically for the first time during a
          Christmas carol concert. Kate has also emphasized environmental
          awareness and sustainability through her initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per reports, King Charles aims to reduce costs and streamline the
          monarchy to core members carrying out official duties. These include
          Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, Princess Anne and Prince Edward
          and his wife Sophie.
        </p>
        <p>
          The promotion indicates Kate’s ever-important position in the new
          royal order. It reflects the faith Charles has in the Princess to take
          on more responsibility as a senior royal.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 41, Kate is the youngest Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter
          after Queen Mary in the early 1900s. Her induction will make her the
          only woman apart from Camilla in the order. It highlights her
          significance and the prominence of her role alongside William.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles is expected to undertake the Order of the Garter appointments
          in June 2023. The ceremony takes place annually at St. George’s Chapel
          in Windsor. The order consists of the monarch, prince consort, and 24
          knights chosen personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in 1348 by King Edward III, it recognizes high achievement and
          public service. The knights wear elaborate blue velvet robes and
          plumed hats for ceremonies. New knights take part in an investiture
          and pageantry-filled service presided by the King.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Kate, being granted powers to endorse royal warrants shortly after
          turning 40 reinforces her image as a dependable future queen consort.
          It reflects the royal family&apos;s confidence in her maturity and
          readiness for more responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          From being a commoner to future Queen, Kate has come a long way. Her
          evolution into a senior working royal will only accelerate after this
          promotion. With King Charles intent on a meritocratic monarchy, Kate
          and Prince William will have to continually prove their mettle as the
          new face of the modern royal family.

          Tensions have escalated along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border after
          Pakistan began demanding passports and visas from Afghan truck drivers
          at the key Torkham crossing on Saturday. For years, truckers have been
          able to cross freely without documents. But the new requirements have
          effectively closed the vital trade route.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noor Mohammad Hanif, an official in Afghanistan&apos;s Nangarhar
          province, said Pakistani officials suddenly started asking Afghan
          drivers for passports and visas at Torkham. Since most drivers do not
          possess these documents, traffic has stalled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In retaliation, Afghanistan has also started demanding the same from
          Pakistani truckers, according to a statement from the Nangarhar
          governor&apos;s office. Officials from both sides are holding
          discussions to resolve the impasse, with a decision expected soon, the
          statement added.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Torkham crossing has experienced closures multiple times in recent
          months, including a nine-day shutdown in September due to border
          forces clashing. On Saturday, dozens of trucks carrying perishable
          items like vegetables and fruits remained stuck on both sides, unable
          to cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysts see this as part of the lingering tensions between Pakistan
          and Afghanistan&apos;s Taliban government. Pakistan is worried about
          the Pakistani Taliban finding sanctuary and regrouping in Afghanistan
          after the Taliban takeover. It has blamed the group for increased
          militant attacks against Pakistani security forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Afghan Taliban denies allowing Pakistani Taliban fighters
          to use its soil for attacks in Pakistan. Last week, senior Pakistani
          politician Fazlur Rehman visited Kabul, the first high-level visit
          since the Taliban takeover, to ease frictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mistrust persists, as evident from the Torkham situation. Pakistan
          remains concerned about militant activity across the porous border.
          Demanding documents from previously exempt truckers appears to be an
          attempt to tighten control and track movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The border crisis comes amid Pakistan&apos;s ongoing expulsion of
          hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghans, further straining ties.
          Since August 2022, over half a million Afghans without valid papers
          have been deported. Pakistan has long hosted nearly 1.7 million
          Afghans who fled the Soviet occupation and subsequent conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this latest standoff, trade and commerce between the two
          countries will be severely impacted. Torkham is a vital commercial
          artery and trade route to Central Asia for Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          For landlocked Afghanistan, access to the Arabian seaports through
          Pakistan is crucial for exports and imports. Disruptions at Torkham
          will choke key supplies of food, medicines and essential commodities.
          It may exacerbate Afghanistan&apos;s humanitarian crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the border remains closed to traffic, prices of goods transported
          by road may rise sharply in both nations. Transporters will also
          suffer major losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid greater public hardship, both sides will have to resolve the
          documentation dispute quickly through diplomatic channels. Wider
          engagement is also needed to address the core issues driving
          Pakistan&apos;s security concerns and perceived threat from
          Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restarting stalled talks between Taliban and Pakistani authorities on
          border management may help instil confidence. But for now, the
          unpredictable border situation highlights the delicate ties between
          the uneasy neighbours.

          The extreme overcrowding in Maharashtra&apos;s state prisons has led
          to a rise in skin diseases among inmates. To address this issue, the
          Maharashtra prison department has introduced washing machines in jails
          for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Yerwada Central Prison in Pune has become the first jail in the
          state to provide washing machines for inmates. So far, all jails have
          placed orders for 193 washing machines in total.
        </p>
        <p>
          On an experimental basis, nine washing machines were installed in
          Yerwada Central Prison last Friday. Prison officials said they would
          study the impact of using washing machines and based on the results,
          considering the needs, install up to 325 washing machines in all jails
          in the near future.

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Yerwada Prison has an official capacity of 2,753 inmates (2,536
              males, 226 females). But currently, there are 6,610 inmates -
              6,324 males and 286 females. Of these, 5,572 inmates are under
              judicial custody, 972 are convicts, and 66 are detained under the
              Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prison authorities said jails across the state face similar
              overcrowding. While overcrowding contributes to the rise in skin
              diseases, disinfecting inmates&apos; clothes and bedding through
              proper washing is essential for prevention, officials said.
            </p>
            <p>
              The introduction of washing machines follows the example of New
              Delhi&apos;s Tihar Jail. Maharashtra&apos;s prison department is
              taking a cue from there, said Amitabh Gupta, Additional Director
              General of Police (Prisons).
            </p>
            <p>
              While the exact number of inmates with skin diseases was
              unavailable, Gupta said it was very high, with long queues at the
              doctor for skin treatment.

              In addition to washing machines, Yerwada Prison inaugurated
              biometric touch screen e-kiosks on Friday. Using the e-kiosks,
              inmates can quickly access information on their case status,
              account balance, hearing dates, and more. Inmates can also have
              online meetings with lawyers and family through the e-mulakat
              application.

              Officials said overcrowding increases chances of unrest in jails.
              Last month, a murder occurred inside Yerwada jail. There are about
              1,200 inmates in Yerwada booked under the Maharashtra Control of
              Organised Crime Act. Jail superintendents have been instructed to
              segregate members of rival gangs and those accused of terrorism,
              naxalism, etc. More CCTV cameras are being installed in 14
              prisons. A panic button system is also proposed to alert officials
              about incidents quickly.

              The prison department plans to construct new jails in several

          Pushyamitra Bhargava left his successful legal career to become the
          mayor of Indore in 2022, promising to bring corporate culture to the
          municipal corporation. Recently, he has drawn attention for directing
          all malls and shops in Indore to install replicas of the Ram Temple in
          Ayodhya. He warned of consequences for those who fail to comply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two weeks ago, Bhargava wrote to all shopkeepers and malls,
          instructing them to install the replicas between January 15-22,
          coinciding with the temple&apos;s consecration anniversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, he justified the order, stating that if Christmas decor is
          allowed from December 25 to January 2, then Ram Temple replicas should
          also be permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before entering politics, Bhargava was the youngest additional
          advocate general of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. Born and raised in
          Indore, he has an M.Phil in Law from Devi Ahilya University, a cyber
          law diploma from Mumbai, and a journalism certificate from Allahabad
          University. During college, he was active in the ABVP, the BJP&apos;s
          student wing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhargava began his legal career under senior advocate Piyush Mathur, a
          former MP High Court judge. He rose to become the state&apos;s
          youngest deputy advocate general from 2015-2018. He represented the
          government in high-profile cases, including on medical oxygen supply
          during Covid, direct student union elections, and a web series
          allegedly insulting the army.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, Bhargava organized events supporting the Citizenship
          Amendment Act. He also led a &quot;Lawyers for Modi&quot; campaign for
          the 2019 elections. Additionally, he formed a youth organization
          called Sanghmitra to connect youth with patriotism and national
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 2022 mayoral polls, Bhargava defeated his Congress opponent by
          a huge margin, becoming BJP&apos;s youngest Indore mayor. His Ram
          temple replica order has now sparked controversy.

          Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has received his fourth summons
          from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning in the
          controversial Delhi excise policy case. The central agency has asked
          him to appear before it on January 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Kejriwal is likely to be in Goa from January 18-20 to oversee
          his Aam Aadmi Party&apos;s election preparations there, posing a
          scheduling conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Delhi CM has skipped ED questioning on three previous occasions,
          citing reasons like impending Rajya Sabha elections, Republic Day
          engagements as Chief Minister, and lack of response from the ED to his
          queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his latest communication to the ED Assistant Director, Kejriwal
          highlighted that the Election Commission has scheduled Rajya Sabha
          polls from Delhi on January 19. As national convener of AAP, which has
          fielded candidates, he is preoccupied with the nominations and
          campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, as Delhi CM, Kejriwal wrote he is busy with Republic Day
          event planning and preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the third instance of Kejriwal questioning the rationale
          behind ED&apos;s summons via written response instead of physically
          appearing. He expressed concern that despite comprehensively
          responding and raising legal objections, the ED chose not to provide
          clarification.
        </p>
        <p>
          In previous letters, Kejriwal termed the summons as politically
          motivated and alleged they were issued to harass him. He asked the ED
          to specify if he is being summoned as a witness or suspect and in what
          capacity. But the ED did not respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agency wants to question Kejriwal in connection with alleged
          irregularities in Delhi&apos;s now-scrapped excise policy. It claims
          kickbacks and corruption took place when the policy was formulated and
          implemented during Kejriwal&apos;s tenure.

          The ED and CBI filed FIRs in the matter after Delhi LG Vinai Kumar
          Saxena recommended a probe. He alleged violations of rules and
          procedural lapses in the policy, which purportedly benefited private
          liquor dealers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides Deputy CM Manish Sisodia who handled the excise portfolio, the
          ED has questioned and arrested other AAP leaders and excise department
          officials. Sisodia has been questioned for over 30 hours so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          AAP has denied any wrongdoing and accused the BJP-led central
          government of a political witchhunt. Kejriwal earlier alleged he is
          being deliberately targeted to stop AAP&apos;s growing national
          footprint ahead of elections in various states.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ED summons have disrupted governance work, claimed AAP. However,
          the BJP retorted that if Kejriwal has done no wrong, he should not
          fear investigation agencies and cooperate.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Kejriwal unlikely to appear on January 18 given his engagements,
          it remains to be seen if the ED will relent or take a strong stand.
          The agency can ask a court to direct Kejriwal to join the probe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some analysts argue ED&apos;s repeated summons are creating an
          impression that it is overzealous about questioning Kejriwal. They
          suggest the agency should discuss the concerns raised in his letters
          before issuing fresh summons.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AAP aims to make inroads in Gujarat and other states, the timing of
          the probe is being seen as intended to dent its prospects. The tussle
          between the Centre and Delhi government looks set to continue, with
          both sides standing firm on their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kejriwal&apos;s non-appearance may provide more ammunition to BJP to
          allege he has something to hide. However, AAP is also likely to use it
          to claim victimization at the hands of the Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the impasse will end remains uncertain. But the excise case has
          certainly introduced new political drama and tensions between
          Delhi&apos;s ruling party and the central government.

          Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India&apos;s longest sea
          bridge, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri Nhava Sheva Atal Setu, also
          known as the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), on Friday. The bridge
          is named after former Prime Minister and BJP veteran Atal Bihari
          Vajpayee.
        </p>
        <p>
          This bridge is set to revolutionize travel for Mumbaikars by reducing
          the two-hour journey from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai to just 20 minutes.
          Under construction for the past six years at a massive cost of around
          Rs 20,000 crores, the Atal Setu has been hailed as a boon for
          commuters.
        </p>
        <p>
          By spanning 22 km over the sea, the bridge drastically cuts down the
          travel distance between Sewri in South Mumbai and Chirle near Nhava
          Sheva in Navi Mumbai from 42 km to 22 km. This not only saves precious
          time but also promotes fuel conservation, addressing a pressing
          concern in busy Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touted as India&apos;s longest sea bridge, the project includes a 16.5
          km long section over the sea and a 5.5 km elevated stretch over land.
          As per officials, it has a design capacity of 70,000 vehicles daily,
          enabling smooth travel at 100 km/hr on average.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting at Sewri and ending at Chirle near Nhava Sheva, the Atal Setu
          offers key interchanges at Sewri, Shivajinagar, State Highway 54, and
          NH-348. This strategic connectivity significantly enhances local links
          while also establishing vital access to Pune, Goa and southern India,
          promoting regional integration.

          After nearly 8 years, the wreckage of an Indian Air Force An-32
          aircraft that went missing in 2016 has finally been discovered on the
          seabed of the Bay of Bengal. The plane, with registration number
          K-2743, had disappeared during a flight from Port Blair to Chennai on
          July 22, 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday, the Indian Air Force announced that debris from the crashed
          aircraft has been located at a depth of approximately 3.4 km, around
          310 km off the Chennai coast. The discovery was made by India&apos;s
          National Institute of Ocean Technology using specialized deep sea
          search equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the IAF statement, NIOT recently deployed an advanced
          Autonomous Underwater Vehicle equipped with deep sea exploration
          capabilities to survey the aircraft&apos;s last known position.
          Multiple sensor payloads were utilized, including multi-beam sonar,
          synthetic aperture sonar and high-resolution photography. Analysis of
          the search imagery revealed the presence of aircraft debris on the
          seabed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were 29 people on board the ill-fated An-32 transport plane that
          fateful day in 2016. After the plane went missing mid-flight, an
          extensive search and rescue operation was launched over the Bay of
          Bengal but no signs of the aircraft or passengers were found.
          Eventually all 29 were presumed dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent discovery of the wreckage thus provides some closure after
          years of the aircraft&apos;s mysterious disappearance. Efforts will
          now focus on attempting to retrieve the flight data recorder as well
          as any remains to aid the investigation into this tragic incident. The
          families of the lost passengers and crew will also get some answers to
          the enduring questions surrounding the crash.

          The U.S. and British militaries bombed over a dozen sites used by
          Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on Thursday. The massive
          retaliatory strike utilized warship and submarine missiles alongside
          fighter jets to target air defenses, drone and missile storage, and
          launching locations, officials said.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden stated the strikes demonstrated the U.S. and allies
          &quot;will not tolerate&quot; the militant group&apos;s relentless
          attacks on the Red Sea. Biden said they only acted after attempts at
          diplomacy and careful consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strikes directly responded to unprecedented Houthi attacks on
          international ships, including first-time use of anti-ship ballistic
          missiles, endangering personnel and trade, Biden explained. He added
          he will take further measures as needed to protect people and
          commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Yemen&apos;s capital Sanaa, journalists heard four explosions early
          Friday local time. Residents in the port city of Hodeida said they
          heard five strong blasts. Witnesses also reported strikes in cities
          south of Sanaa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinated assault marked the first U.S. military response to the
          Houthis&apos; persistent attacks on commercial vessels since the
          Israel-Hamas war began. It came just a week after the U.S. and
          partners warned the Houthis to stop or risk potential military action.
          The warning briefly deterred attacks before the rebels&apos;
          largest-ever drone and missile barrage on shipping Tuesday, prompting
          U.S. and British ships to shoot down missiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials said after Tuesday&apos;s attacks, Biden met with advisors
          and directed the retaliatory strikes. The UK confirmed its Royal Air
          Force took part, with fighters from Cyprus. Allied nations joined the
          U.S. and UK in saying they won&apos;t hesitate to defend lives and
          commerce, though the aim is de-escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis vowed retaliation, warning any attack will spark a fierce
          response beyond imagination. Houthi-run media described strikes
          hitting bases, airports and camps. Casualties remain unclear.
          Officials don&apos;t expect the strikes will eliminate Houthi
          capabilities but may prompt retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis say their attacks aim to stop Israel&apos;s war in Gaza.
          But their targets increasingly have little connection to Israel while
          imperiling a crucial Asia-Europe trade route. The UN Security Council
          passed a resolution Wednesday demanding the Houthis immediately halt
          attacks and implicitly condemned their Iranian weapons suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The broad coalition battling the Houthis shows the Biden
          administration&apos;s effort to avoid appearing unilateral. Multiple
          ships have already been struck despite a U.S.-led maritime mission to
          protect shipping. The U.S. long declined to signal when patience would
          run out before Wednesday&apos;s warning of consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reluctance reflected sensitivities about the shaky Yemen truce and
          worries about triggering wider regional conflict. But the
          attacks&apos; impact on shipping and escalation triggered the
          coalition warning. The strikes underscored using a united front rather
          than opening a new war front alone.

          A tragic incident occurred at the prestigious Indian Institute of
          Technology Kanpur (IIT-K) where an MTech student was found dead in his
          hostel room on Wednesday evening. According to police, the 26-year-old
          student, Vikas Kumar Meena, appeared to have died by suicide though
          further investigations are underway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vikas was enrolled in the Aerospace Engineering department at IIT-K
          and originally hailed from Meerut. After visiting the campus and
          speaking to faculty and students, Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner
          Akhil Kumar shared some preliminary findings though noted the probe is
          still ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stated that on Wednesday evening, Vikas&apos;s death in his hostel
          room was reported and at first glance, it seems to be a potential
          suicide case. However, only after a full post-mortem examination and
          further investigations can police definitively determine causes and
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police have obtained a digital copy of a purported suicide note which
          cites some academic issues that Vikas was facing. The note apparently
          claims no one else should be blamed for his actions. However,
          authorities are still working to verify the authenticity of the note
          and confirm it was written by Vikas before his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to investigating officials, some of Vikas&apos;s peers had
          gone to his locked hostel room after not getting any response to their
          knocks. When he still did not respond, institute officials were
          informed and the room&apos;s lock was broken, only to discover
          Vikas&apos;s body hanging inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking to media, Vikas&apos;s father Anil Kumar Meena revealed his
          son had grown depressed after recently receiving an academic
          termination notice from IIT-K which he could not timely appeal
          against. Anil claims Vikas felt he could have gotten the notice
          repealed if granted the appeal opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police are still holding on to Vikas&apos;s mobile phone and the
          alleged suicide note. Anil described his son as a very friendly person
          and believes the termination notice directly led to his suicide due to
          resulting depression.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, IIT-K officials clarified that such termination warning
          letters are meant to prompt students to meet with faculty and address
          their issues, and can be easily challenged to get revoked. But Vikas
          apparently did not take these steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its statement, IIT-K called Vikas an academically bright student
          who joined the MTech program in 2021. Losing him is a major loss for
          the institute and his passing is deeply upsetting, the statement
          added. Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner also mentioned having
          discussions with IIT-K&apos;s Director to ascertain the full
          circumstances and consider corrective actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The investigation into Vikas&apos;s tragic death remains ongoing as
          police work to conclusively determine the causes and events leading up
          to the suspected suicide. His family, friends and the IIT-K community
          are grieving the devastating loss of a promising young student and
          individual.

          An Ohio woman who was criminally charged for allegedly mishandling a
          home miscarriage will not be indicted, a grand jury decided on
          Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor&apos;s office in Trumbull County said the grand jury
          declined to charge Brittany Watts, 34, of Warren with abuse of a
          corpse. This resolved a controversial case that drew national
          attention for its implications for pregnant women as states enact new
          laws on reproductive healthcare access post - Roe v. Wade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision came just before around 150 supporters gathered for a
          rally supporting Watts in Warren&apos;s Courthouse Square. Watts
          addressed the crowd, thanking her community and declaring she will
          continue fighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watts&apos; attorney said an outpouring of public support helped her
          client endure being charged with a felony. The lawyer stated that
          despite how upsetting it sounds, Watts&apos; experience reflects the
          sad reality of miscarriage. They expressed relief and gratitude that
          the grand jury reached a just decision today.
        </p>
        <p>
          A municipal judge previously found probable cause against Watts.
          Prosecutors alleged she miscarried into a toilet, removed contents to
          outdoor trash, and left the 22-week fetus lodged in pipes. Records
          show her doctor advised hospital induction due to nonviable pregnancy
          and serious risks. But complications and delays prevented treatment.
          After miscarrying at home, she unsuccessfully tried going to a hair
          appointment before friends insisted she go to the hospital. A
          nurse&apos;s 911 call spurred the ensuing investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor argued the issue was not how or when the fetus died,
          but that Watts discarded it in the toilet, clogging it, and went about
          her day. An autopsy found the fetus died in utero with no recent
          injuries. Watts&apos; lawyer contended she had no criminal record and
          was being vilified for a common occurrence. The lawyer also questioned
          whether the abuse-of-corpse statute clearly defined terms like
          &quot;corpse&quot; and &quot;outrage&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          After binding the case over, the judge acknowledged better scholars
          should determine the fetus&apos;s precise legal status. Now, the
          prosecutor says further investigation found Watts committed no crime,
          despite disagreeing with the lower court&apos;s law application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advocates expressed relief at the outcome, but warned Watts&apos; case
          exemplifies the threats Black women face for pregnancy outcomes amid
          abortion restrictions. They called for ending the criminalization of
          reproductive outcomes, which undermines rights and deters necessary
          care. Watts hopes her experience prompts change through education and
          legislation so no other woman endures similar trauma fighting for
          freedom.

          In a tragic example of a failed romantic relationship, a man in Mumbai
          killed his partner. Three months ago, the pair connected on social
          media. The incident happened in Navi Mumbai&apos;s Turbhe. The crime
          blurred the lines between revenge and love when a 24-year-old man
          named Shoaib Sheikh planned the 35-year-old bank manager Amit Kaur—a
          divorcee and mother of a teenage girl was killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story started a few months ago, when Shoaib and Amit connected on
          social media. When Shoaib arrived in Turbhe on January 8th to
          celebrate Kaur&apos;s birthday, what appeared to be a blossoming
          romance took a dark turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the details given by the police, it appears that Shoaib
          killed Amit Kaur by strangulation in a lodge where they were
          celebrating, driven by feelings of suspicion and grief. Shoaib left
          the scene after carrying out the horrific deed, leaving the staff to
          discover the woman&apos;s lifeless body when they opened the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shoaib Sheikh was taken into custody by the Sakinaka police in Mumbai
          after they carried out an investigation. After being arrested, the
          young man—who worked in a garage—finally admitted to the crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the police, Shoaib&apos;s misgivings about his lover
          ultimately motivated him to commit the murder. The victim, a
          well-liked bank manager, had no idea what evil plans had been
          simmering inside of Shoaib.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic event clarified the effects of a relationship poisoned by
          suspicion and deceit. The community was left reeling from the shocking
          reality that had descended upon them as the legal proceedings
          progressed and the dark secrets underlying this bizarre story of love
          and betrayal continued to come to light.

          The word &quot;Veg&quot; is clearly visible on the wrapper of her food

          Ankita Bhandari, 19, was murdered in September 2022 while working as a
          receptionist in an upscale resort in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand. Since
          then, the murder has taken a new turn, with her mother calling for the
          arrest of a prominent member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party
          (BJP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother, Soni Devi, reportedly made the claim in a video,
          claiming that BJP MLA Renu Bisht had given the order to destroy
          evidence linked to the murder case by burning the victim&apos;s room
          at the Vanantra Resort, where her daughter worked as a receptionist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that BJP leader Vinod Arya&apos;s son Pulkit and two others
          were arrested following a furious public outcry following the
          disappearance of Ankita, whose body was subsequently discovered in
          Rishikesh&apos;s Chilla barrage. The luxurious resort&apos;s owner,
          Pulkit, is said to have thrown her into the water when she resisted
          being made to serve a VIP guest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl&apos;s mother also claimed that the state BJP secretary, Ajay
          Kumar, had appeared in witness statements nearly a year and a half
          after the crime, and she urged Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar
          Singh Dhami to act right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the intense public outcry surrounding the Ankita Bhandari
          murder case in 2022, the Uttarakhand Police assigned the case to a
          special investigation team (SIT) headed by senior IPS officer P Renuka
          Devi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Declaring that the Dhami government had betrayed her, Soni Devi
          expressed &quot;Arrest Ajay Kumar as it&apos;s evident that his name
          surfaced in the probe as the VIP who visited the resort,&quot; Soni
          Devi stated in the Sunday video statement. It added &quot;Arrest MLA
          Renu Bisht as well as Pramod Kumar, the former SDM, who gave the order
          for a JCB driver to destroy Ankita&apos;s room.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspector General of Police Nilesh Anand Bharne told news agency ANI
          that &quot;no evidence or statement about any VIP was presented during
          the investigation and testimony in court.&quot; He also stated that
          &quot;many serious allegations have been made by Ankita
          Bhandari&apos;s parents in the media and the social media about the
          so-called VIPs.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The accusations made by Ankita&apos;s mother have also been refuted by
          the BJP. &quot;In a fit of rage, Ankita&apos;s parents have made
          accusations, and the Congress party is expressing its frustration over
          electoral setbacks. The BJP leader&apos;s character is being attacked
          by the opposition using Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s remarks as
          cover. The government and the BJP are with the victim&apos;s family
          and justice will be done in the case as it is sub judice.&quot;, news
          reports as such cited a party leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a PTI report, Uttarakhand Congress president Karan Mahara
          shared Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s video statement and asked,
          &quot;When will Dhami answer our daughter Ankita Bhandari&apos;s
          mother&apos;s tears?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother further claimed in her statement that his wife
          had been sent to Pithoragarh and that the Dhami government had falsely
          filed a case against social worker Ashutosh Negi, who was assisting
          her in the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I will sacrifice my life if the case against Negi is not dropped
          soon and his wife&apos;s transfer is not cancelled,&quot; the woman
          declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahara stated that similar accusations had also been made by
          Ankita&apos;s father in a letter addressed to the Pauri District
          Magistrate, and that the entire incident ought to be looked into under
          the supervision of a sitting High Court judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It is imperative that action be taken against these allegations
          if there is even the slightest degree of truth,&quot; he declared.

          Regarding disqualification petitions submitted by organizations led by
          former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Shinde, Rahul Narwekar
          rendered a decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Wednesday, the Speaker declared that the Thackeray-led faction had
          not submitted any documentation indicating that a meeting of the Shiv
          Sena&apos;s national executive had taken place to determine which
          faction of the party was the legitimate one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court gave Narwekar another deadline extension on December
          15, ordering him to make a decision on the petitions by January 10.
          The Maharashtra Speaker was initially instructed by a five-judge bench
          led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud to hear and rule on the
          disqualification petitions within a “reasonable time” in May of last
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena broke up in June 2022 when Chief Minister Eknath Shinde
          rebelled against Thackeray&apos;s Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition,
          claiming the backing of 39 of the party&apos;s 55 MLAs in addition to
          10 independent MLAs. In the government, allies included the Congress,
          the Nationalist Congress Party, and the Shiv Sena.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Thackeray faction has demanded the disqualification of Shinde and
          other MLAs. There were 34 such petitions pending before the Speaker in
          total.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Thackeray, had petitioned the Supreme
          Court on the eve of Narwekar&apos;s verdict, citing concerns about a
          recent meeting between Shinde and Narwekar, according to NDTV. This
          was compared by the former chief minister to a &quot;judge meeting a
          criminal.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray charged the Maharashtra
          government of trying to silence the opinions of those outside the
          ruling class ahead of the Speaker&apos;s decision on Wednesday,
          according to ANI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leader of the Nationalist Congress Party and acting deputy speaker
          Narhari Zirwal initiated the disqualification process in June 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court ruled in May that former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat
          Singh Koshyari had erred in concluding that the Shinde-led rebellion
          had caused the Thackeray government to lose its majority. However, the
          court further ruled that the Maha Vikas Aghadi could not be reinstated
          after Thackeray resigned without being put to a floor test.

              Gangs that are connected to powerful cartels in Mexico and

              violence, including attacking television studios, setting off

              Ecuador is a prime target for drug trafficking organizations due
              to its strategic location on the cocaine trade route that connects
              Peru and Colombia.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Ecuador, drug-related violence has been on the rise for a long
              time; between 2018 and 2022, the murder rate quadrupled, peaking
              at over 7,800 killings last year.
            </li>
            <li>
              In an effort to increase their power and influence, rival gangs
              connected to the cartels in Mexico and Colombia fight for control
              of drug routes and territory in Ecuador.
            </li>
            <li>
              The country&apos;s faltering economy, in addition to extreme
              poverty and inequality, has made it an ideal environment for gang
              recruitment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unrest within Ecuador&apos;s penitentiaries and an inefficient
              prison system that allows well-known criminals to evade justice
              have both substantially contributed to the rise in violence.

          Narendra Modi&apos;s visit to Lakshadweep.
        </p>
        <p>
          MATATO stated that they &quot;did not reflect sentiments of Maldivians
          in general&quot; and urged EaseMyTrip to ignore them. MATATO
          emphasized that Indian travelers are indispensable force in the
          success of the Maldivian tourism sector, providing vital support to
          small to medium-sized enterprises&quot; highlighting the need for
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a statement, the Maldives tourism board praised Indian visitors,
          who have become the country&apos;s largest group of foreign visitors
          since COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;As we offer our sincere thanks for the long-lasting friendship
          and cooperation that characterize the Maldives&apos; relationship with
          India, we want you to know that these ties go beyond issues of
          politics. We love and cherish our Indian counterparts as brothers and
          sisters.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With over two-thirds of the Maldives&apos; GDP coming from the
          tourism industry and 44,000 Maldivians employed in it, tourism is the
          lifeblood of the islands. The possible negative effect on tourism has
          the capacity to have catastrophic effects on our economy.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on information provided by the Maldives Tourism Ministry, over
          4.5 lakh Indian tourists have come to the nation over the previous two
          years, including over two lakh visitors last year. When the Maldives
          was still open to visitors, approximately 63,000 Indians went there
          despite the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, the Maldives Association of Tourism Industry (MATI) denounced
          remarks made disparagingly about Prime Minister Modi. MATATO also
          urged people to abstain from using offensive language that exacerbates
          division.

          &quot;There has been a noticeable increase in the number of people
          being duped by dubious and unlawful lending apps. Many people who
          become entangled in the network of these apps often turn to extreme
          measures, like suicide. Two new illicit lending apps appear for each
          one that is banned. It&apos;s turned into a whack-a-mole game,&quot;
          Kamath wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went on to discuss the strategies these apps employ to generate
          revenue. &quot;The fact that many of these apps deduct as much as 10%
          upfront is what makes them disgusting,&quot; he said. Furthermore,
          interest rates can vary from fifty percent to one hundred percent, or
          even higher. People that borrow money through these applications are
          unable to return it on such exorbitant terms. However, since that
          users of these apps are in need, they overlook the fine print.&quot;

        <p>
          He further warned individuals that these loan sharks may use physical
          threats in order to get money back at the conclusion of his tweet. By
          phoning all of their contacts and sharing their private images, they
          can also harass others.

              Calangute police station inspector Paresh Naik stated that Suchana
              Seth and her son moved into a rented service apartment in
              Candolim, North Goa, on January 6.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following a few days of stay, Seth informed the apartment staff
              that she needed to go to Bengaluru for work and requested that
              they set up a taxi, according to Naik.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of hiring a taxi, which is an expensive option, the staff
              recommended that she take a flight to Bengaluru, which would be
              less expensive, the police officer said.
            </p>
            <p>
              The woman insisted that she would only take a taxi, and on January
              8 early in the morning, a car was arranged for her.

            <p>
              He claimed that blood stains were discovered on a towel when the
              apartment staff went to clean the room where she had stayed later.
              The apartment&apos;s management notified the Calangute Police
              right away.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the staff reported to the police that Seth was seen
              carrying an abnormally heavy bag when she left the apartment and
              that her four-year-old son was not seen with her.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, she received a call from the police asking her about
              her missing son and the bloodstains.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response, the woman said that her monthly period was to blame
              for the bloodstains. She gave the address and mentioned that her
              son was in Margao town, South Goa, with her friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Naik, the police realized right away that the address
              she had provided was a fake after enlisting the assistance of the
              Fatorda Police (near Margao).
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, the taxi driver, who was traveling to Bengaluru and had
              arrived in the Karnataka district of Chitradurga, was instructed
              by the inspector over the phone to transport the accused person to
              the closest police station.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Naik, when the Chitradurga police examined the
              woman&apos;s bag, they discovered the child&apos;s body.

              transported to Goa.

          This follows a controversy that started when a few Maldivian
          politicians disparaged Prime Minister Modi and made fun of his most
          recent trip to Lakshadweep. India brought up the issue with Male in a
          strong manner, and the leaders of the island nation&apos;s opposition
          criticized the ruling class for the disagreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maldivian deputy minister of youth empowerment, Mariyam Shiuna,
          made a derogatory and mocking reference to Prime Minister Modi in a
          post that has since been removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comments incited a fierce backlash in India. The Maldives
          government rejected the disparaging remarks, claiming they did not
          reflect Male&apos;s opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three deputy ministers were also suspended by the Maldivian government
          on Sunday for disparaging remarks about Prime Minister Modi on social
          media. Ibrahim Khaleel, a spokesman for the Maldivian president,
          stated, &quot;All government officials responsible for the comments
          have been suspended from their post effective immediately.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the row, a number of well-known Indians, including cricketer
          Sachin Tendulkar, actor Akshay Kumar, actor Salman Khan, and actor
          Aakash Chopra, joined an online campaign advocating for a boycott of
          the Maldives and its tourist attractions.

        <p>
          Amidst the boycott of the Maldives, online travel agency EaseMyTrip

          would suspend all reservations for flights to the Maldives.

          PM Modi visited the union territory on January 2 and posted a number
          of photos, including one of him snorkelling, which he described as a

          West to attack Russian targets, but it declined to comment on claims
          made by the US and Ukraine that Moscow had fired North Korean missiles
          at targets in Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The White House announced last week that Russia had launched several
          strikes against Ukraine using short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs)
          that were obtained from North Korea, citing recently declassified
          intelligence. Later on, a senior Ukrainian official confirmed the
          report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, both Moscow and Pyongyang
          have grown closer, despite their denials of having any arms deals. In
          September of last year, President Vladimir Putin and North Korean
          leader Kim Jong Un met in the Far East of Russia, and senior Russian
          officials have since visited Pyongyang multiple times.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about the allegations made by the United States and
          Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded, &quot;No
          comment&quot;, to a call with reporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peskov said that Ukraine had been using missiles made by
          &quot;Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and other
          countries&quot; to strike civilian targets inside Russia on multiple
          occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 30, an attack by Ukraine on the Russian border city of
          Belgorod resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including two
          children, and 111 injuries, according to Russian media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Belgorod region, which borders northern Ukraine, has experienced
          drone attacks and shelling this year, similar to other Russian border
          zones, which the authorities have attributed to Ukraine, though none
          had ever been this severe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stated goals of Moscow&apos;s Feb. 24, 2022, deployment of tens of
          thousands of troops into Ukraine were &quot;demilitarising&quot; and
          &quot;denazifying&quot; the nation. Moscow has stated that Western
          countries, including the US, are accountable for the fallout from
          arming Kyiv.

          After forty years, the greater one-horned rhinoceros has made a
          comeback to the Laokhowa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary in central
          Assam, according to officials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until 1983, there were at least 45 rhinos living in the 309.2 sq.
          km. wildlife sanctuary (WLS) in the Nagaon district, which is a part
          of the Greater Kaziranga landscape. Although stray rhinos from Orang
          National Park across the Brahmaputra River and the Kaziranga National
          Park to the east were known to briefly enter the WLS, widespread
          encroachment and poaching ultimately led to their extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the return of our famous rhinos to Laokhowa
          and Burachapori, after a 40-year absence, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa
          Sarma posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday night. Stating that
          they had returned within a year of our successful anti-encroachment
          operation in the area. He also mentioned that following the eviction
          drive in 2023, 51.7 square kilometers of forest cover had been
          recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to wildlife officials, the two rhinos are thought to have
          entered through Arimari, where between February 13 and 15, 2023,
          encroachers were removed from 1,282 hectares of forest land and 817
          hectares of unsurveyed government land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since November 2023, rhinos have been seen in Laokhowa-Burachapori, a
          great place for freshwater mangroves to live. The WLS also has ten
          tigers on file, suggesting a healthy base of herbivorous prey for
          these animals, according to Kaziranga&apos;s field director, Sonali
          Ghosh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent filling of 75 frontline positions and the recruitment of
          new personnel have been credited with increasing sanctuary protection.

          In light of the growing diplomatic ties between the two countries,

          cooperation between India and the Maldives. China&apos;s announcement

          Editorial in China&apos;s official media — Global Times — discusses
          the growing diplomatic spat between India and the Maldives in the wake
          of insulting remarks made by Maldivian ministers against Prime
          Minister Narendra Modi.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It also respects the friendly and cooperative relationship
          between the Maldives and India, fully aware of the importance for Male
          to maintain good relations with New Delhi,&quot; reads the editorial
          in China&apos;s Global Times. Beijing does not see cooperation between
          the Maldives and India as hostile or dangerous, and it has never asked
          Male to reject New Delhi due to disputes between China and India,
          according to an editorial in the Global Times.
        </p>
        <p>
          It went on to say: &quot;China is also open to implementing trilateral
          cooperation with the Maldives, India, and China. Since China does not
          view its cooperation with South Asian nations as a zero-sum endeavor,

              Muizzu is currently on a five-day visit to China with Sajidha

            </li>
            <li>
              Muizzu is seen as pro-Chinese, and since taking office, he has
              been strengthening relations with the nation led by Xi Jinping.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Maldives and India have long had close relations. India was a
              close collaborator of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, Muizzu&apos;s
              predecessor.
            </li>

        <p>
          The Maldives President&apos;s Office stated that H.E. Xi Jinping, the
          president of China, has invited this visit. When Muizzu arrived at the
          airport in Fujian, he was observed being welcomed by Chinese
          officials. President Xi Jinping of China has invited Muizzu and his
          spouse on a state visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Muizzu of the Maldives is on his first bilateral visit since
          taking office on December 17 of last year. Rumor has it that during
          Muizzu&apos;s visit, China and the Maldives will have formal
          discussions and sign important agreements to improve trade,
          professional growth, and socioeconomic cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Muizzu will also meet important Chinese business executives at the
          Invest Maldives Forum in Fuzhou. The President&apos;s Office of the
          Maldives released a statement saying, &quot;The visit aims to pave the
          way for technological and other collaborations between the two
          countries.&quot; The President and First Lady of the Maldives are
          accompanied by a high-level delegation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maldives President&apos;s Office stated, &quot;Additionally, the
          President will meet with senior Chinese government officials, attend
          the Invest Maldives Forum, and have meetings with senior Chinese
          business leaders to explore avenues of mutual collaborations in
          investments and trade between the Maldives and China.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          On October 14, 1972, China and the Maldives established diplomatic
          relations. Since that time, China and the Maldives have made a
          concerted effort to strengthen their friendship.

          More than 100,000 devotees are expected to congregate in Ayodhya on
          January 22 for the Ram Mandir&apos;s &quot;pran pratishtha&quot;
          ceremony, according to the reports. It is planned for Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi to attend the function.

          The general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, Champat
          Rai, says that the Ram temple will have particular dimensions and be
          built in the traditional Nagara style. 161 feet in height, 250 feet in
          width, and 380 feet long from east to west. The temple will have
          twenty feet on each floor, three hundred and ninety-two pillars, and
          forty-four gates.

          Chief of the Shiv Sena, Uddhav Thackeray, announced that he would
          perform a Maha Aarti at the Godavari riverbank in Nashik on January
          22, which is the day the Ram temple in Ayodhya opens. He also plans to
          go to the Kalaram temple in Panchavati, which is thought to be the
          location of Lord Ram&apos;s stay during his banishment. Although
          Uddhav was not invited to the inauguration of the Ram temple, Shiv
          Sena and BJP leaders got into a verbal altercation over this.

          Social media was rocked by Maldivian politicians&apos; remarks about
          Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&apos;s visit to Lakshadweep, which
          revealed more about the two nations&apos; relationship than just
          tourism.

          Mohamed Muizzu, the recently elected president of the Maldives, has
          requested that India remove its troops from the island nation. The
          troops are in charge of three exquisite aircraft that are being used
          for patrol.
        </p>
        <p>
          What really infuriated Indians, though, were remarks made by
          politicians in the Maldives that were deemed racist. As a result, many
          Indians called for a boycott of travel to the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous well-known people have expressed their support for
          Modi&apos;s expedition and encouraged tourists to visit Indian

          <p>
            The tourism industry, which generates the majority of the
            country&apos;s foreign exchange earnings and government revenue, is
            a major contributor to the Maldivian economy. Due to its gorgeous
            beaches, opulent lodging options, and mouthwatering seafood, the
            island nation has become a popular travel destination in South Asia.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Maldivian Tourism Ministry reports that 161,751 arrivals from
          India were registered in November 2023 alone, making up nearly 20% of
          all arrivals. In the meantime, Indians held the second position in
          market share from January to November 2023, accounting for 10.9
          percent of all arrivals, or 181, 371 arrivals, in the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          India ranked as the fifth-largest country from which tourists arrived
          in the Maldives in 2018. Approximately 6.1% (more than 90,474) of the
          14,84,274 tourists came from India. Nevertheless, India ranked second
          in 2019 with 1,66,030 arrivals, nearly twice as many as the previous
          year. With almost 63,000 Indian tourists visiting the Maldives in the
          pandemic-hit year 2020, India accounted for the Maldives&apos; largest
          source market. With over 2.91 lakh and 2.41 lakh tourist arrivals from
          India, respectively, and a 23 percent and 14.4 percent market share,
          India remained the leading market in 2021 and 2022.

            Education, finance, and defense: India helps the Maldives
          </span>
          <p>
            India and the Maldives have collaborated closely in defense and
            security since 1988. Regarding meeting the Maldives&apos;
            requirements for defense hardware and training, India has been
            incredibly accommodating and adaptable. As of late, it has signed a
            comprehensive Action Plan for Defence in April 2016 and has
            continued to provide defense hardware, upgrade defense
            infrastructure, and train Maldivian forces.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Regarding financial support, the Maldives received an additional $100
          million in funding from the Modi administration in November 2022. The
          help came in the shape of budgetary support to help the archipelago
          nation get through its challenging economic times. It should be
          mentioned that the aid is being provided unconditionally, and the
          Maldives has been allowed to use it however it sees fit to aid in its
          economic recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          India further solidified its reputation as the “first responder” when
          it quickly sent 30,000 doses of the measles vaccine to the Maldives in
          January 2020 to stop an outbreak. India also provided the Maldives
          with prompt, all-encompassing assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, a number of young Maldivians attend Indian universities to
          pursue higher education. For many years, Maldivian schools located
          throughout the islands have employed Indian educators. Maldivian youth
          have historically been awarded a significant number of ICCR
          scholarships by India, specifically 39 for 2021-2022 and 34+ for
          2022-2023 & 2023-2024.

            series; people can die, be consumed, beaten, tortured, shot,

            violence isn&apos;t depicted any more graphically than it would be
            in a show like Game of Thrones. Characters are occasionally seen
            smoking and drinking wine, but these scenes don&apos;t have a
            recurring theme.

          Three teenage girls from a small rural village in Tamil Nadu were
          determined to overcome the vast distance separating them from their
          beloved K-pop idols in faraway Seoul, South Korea. The sensational
          band BTS had captured their hearts and imaginations. However, the
          girls only managed to get as far as Chennai before their dream
          collided with reality on the second day of their audacious journey.
          Exhausted and out of money, they were discovered by police late at
          night at a railway station near Vellore as they attempted to make
          their way back home. The authorities immediately took the girls into
          protective custody and transported them to a government-run
          children&apos;s shelter in Vellore district.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to officials, the girls&apos; plan was to sail all the way
          to Seoul from a port in Andhra Pradesh, a route they had managed to
          cobble together after extensive online research. But their lack of
          resources and preparation meant this goal was wildly unrealistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three girls come from humble, lower-middle class families in a
          village located in Karur district. One girl&apos;s mother works as a
          teacher at a local village primary school. However, her father suffers
          from mental health issues that impact the family. Another girl has
          separated parents, with her mother barely scraping by as a farm
          laborer. But the third friend comes from a more stable home
          environment, though still modest in means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somehow, despite their economic disadvantages, the girls had
          internet-connected phones at home which appear to have fueled their
          almost obsessive fascination with BTS. They dove deep into the digital
          realm of the band&apos;s online fanbase, teaching themselves what they
          could about Korean language and music. According to the
          district&apos;s Child Welfare Committee Chairman, the girls had
          researched their idols extensively, knowing intricate details about
          each band member down to their hobbies, favorite outfits, and eating
          habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their passion for the music group seems to have sparked an intense
          longing within the girls to escape the confines of their small village
          and pursue dreams of dance, music, and stardom. This motivation
          propelled them to raid their meager savings, take money from piggy
          banks, and set off on their quest no matter how irrational.
        </p>
        <p>
          After two days of freedom, the harsh realities of the world crashed
          in. The girls&apos; lack of maturity and planning led them to abandon
          their mission once exhaustion and homesickness kicked in. After
          counseling sessions with child welfare authorities, the girls
          expressed regret over their rash actions and promised not to undertake
          such an irresponsible journey again. For now, they wait patiently,
          albeit anxiously, for their parents to come bring them home. The
          counselors aim to provide guidance to the girls and their families
          before allowing them to reunite.

          As Bangladesh prepares for nationwide elections today, the country is
          on high alert with tightened security measures amid fears of potential
          violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vote holds major significance for India, as Prime Minister Sheikh
          Hasina, a key ally, seeks a fourth straight term while the main
          opposition boycotts the polls. India is closely monitoring this
          electoral process, expected to shape the political landscape of its
          eastern neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies are refusing to
          participate, insisting no fair or credible election can occur under
          the current government. The BNP has called a 48-hour nationwide
          general strike starting this morning through Monday morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          A BNP spokesperson said the strike aims to demand the resignation of
          the &quot;illegal government,&quot; establishment of a nonpartisan
          caretaker government, and release of imprisoned opposition leaders and
          activists. Notably, former premier and BNP leader Khaleda Zia remains
          under house arrest on graft convictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The absence of a formidable challenger paves the way for Hasina&apos;s
          Awami League party to win easily. However, this risks deepening
          authoritarianism in Bangladesh. The BNP argues elections without them
          lack legitimacy. But the Awami League insists people still have
          candidate choices from smaller parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clashes between party supporters this month killed at least six
          people, underscoring tensions. Rights groups decry crackdowns on
          dissent under Hasina, which the government denies. While India has
          concerns about Hasina&apos;s authoritarian streak, it sees her as key
          to providing stability and maintaining close ties.

        <p>
          On Saturday, a federal appeals court upheld a judge&apos;s decision
          that prevented California from enforcing a recently enacted law
          prohibiting the carrying of firearms in most public spaces, citing its
          unconstitutionality. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a
          previous order that temporarily suspended an injunction against the
          law. The original injunction had been issued by a judge who determined
          that the state&apos;s Democratic-led legislation violated
          citizens&apos; Second Amendment rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earlier order, which had briefly lifted the injunction, allowing
          the law to take effect on January 1, was dissolved by a different
          panel of judges on Saturday in response to a request from gun rights
          groups. CD Michel, legal representative for these groups, stated,
          &quot;So the politicians&apos; attempt to circumvent the Second
          Amendment has been halted, at least for now.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          California&apos;s appeal of the injunction is now scheduled for a
          hearing in April. The state&apos;s attorney general argued in court
          documents that blocking the law would expose tens of millions of
          Californians to an increased risk of gun violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision was met with criticism from Daniel Villaseñor, a
          spokesperson for Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who signed the law
          in September. Villaseñor argued that the court&apos;s ruling
          jeopardizes the safety of Californians.
        </p>
        <p>
          The law in question was enacted in response to a significant Supreme
          Court ruling in June 2022 that broadened gun rights nationwide. In the
          case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v Bruen, the
          conservative-majority Supreme Court struck down New York&apos;s
          stringent gun permit system and affirmed the right to carry handguns
          in public for self-defense under the Second Amendment. The ruling also
          introduced a new test for assessing the constitutionality of gun laws,
          emphasizing consistency with the nation&apos;s historical tradition of
          firearm regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the Supreme Court decision, California, along with other
          states, sought to revise its firearm regulations. Senate Bill 2, the
          contested law in California, prohibited the carrying of concealed guns
          in various &quot;sensitive places,&quot; such as hospitals,
          playgrounds, stadiums, zoos, and places of worship, irrespective of
          concealed carry permits. Additionally, the law restricted concealed
          carry at privately owned commercial establishments open to the public,
          unless the business explicitly permitted license holders to carry
          firearms on the premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          US District Judge Cormac Carney, appointed by former President George
          W. Bush, sided with permit holders and gun rights groups on December
          20, declaring that the law violated the Second Amendment.

          India&apos;s campaign against Ireland kicks off on June 5 in New York.
          On June 9 and June 12, Pakistan and the USA will also play at the same
          location. On June 15, they will play Canada in their last group match.
          The Super 8 matches will take place from June 19-24, after the group
          stage runs from June 1-18. The tournament&apos;s semi-finals and final
          are scheduled for June 26-27 and June 29 respectively. Guyana will
          host the first semifinal, while Trinidad will host the second. There
          will be a final in Barbados.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be the first tournament held in a new format, with 20 teams
          instead of just 16. The USA and the West Indies are the hosts in the
          meantime. The tournament&apos;s move away from a global qualifier and
          toward a focus on regional qualification tournaments is another
          significant change to the new format. Two qualifying spots were
          awarded to each of Africa, Asia, and Europe, while the Americas and
          East Asia and Pacific each received one spot. Using this route, the
          teams from Ireland, Canada, Namibia, Scotland, Oman, Papua New Guinea,
          Uganda, and Nepal have qualified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the new format, there will be two group stages involving the 20
          teams and then the semi-finals. The previous format, which was in use
          until 2022, had a qualification stage with associate and lower ranked
          countries before a Super 12 stage and then the knockouts. Five groups,
          each consisting of four teams, will be formed from the teams. Teams
          that place first and second in each of these groups advance to the
          Super 8s, where they will be split into two groups of four players
          each. Teams that place first and second advance to the semi-finals.

              Aditya L1 began a maneuver on September 19 in order to defy

              direction of the Lagrangian point.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aditya L1 used its onboard thrusters to correct its course on

              To help clarify, lets do a comparison with Chandrayaan 3. Similar
              to how we launched Aditya L1, Chandrayaan 3 orbited the earth on
              July 14 in order to elevate its orbit.
            </li>
            <li>
              On July 31, Chandrayaan 3 entered the translunar injection phase
              of its lunar voyage. We had confirmation by August 5 that the
              moon&apos;s gravity had taken Chandrayaan hostage. We maneuvered
              to alter the spacecraft&apos;s orientation on this crucial day.
            </li>
            <li>
              The spacecraft moves forward when it is moving away from Earth
              thanks to thrusters at the back. But when we want to be pulled
              down by the gravity of another star, we turn around and accelerate
              the spacecraft by bringing the thrusters to the front. Our Mars
              Orbiter Mission and Chandrayaan 3 both used this standard
              procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Aditya L1 probe will perform the same maneuver again tomorrow,
              but it should be noted that it must orbit a void rather than a
              celestial body. Additionally, this manoeuvre will only last a few
              seconds, as opposed to the terrifying 17 minutes during the lunar
              landing experience.

          The important point to note is that our liquid apogee motors have been
          in a hibernation state since a few months ago because of the cold
          space environment. The important thing is to make sure the motors
          respond to commands by starting up quickly, firing for the desired
          amount of time, and precisely performing the maneuver at the critical
          moment. To prevent overdoing, underdoing, or timing errors in the
          motor firing, this calls for accuracy.

        In a significant show of support for Moscow, North Korea has given
        Russia ballistic missiles and missile launchers that were utilized in
        recent attacks on Ukraine, the White House announced on Thursday.
        <br />
        <br />
        Russia is reportedly in need of missiles from its ally Iran because,
        almost two years after President Vladimir Putin&apos;s invasion of
        Ukraine, it is out of supplies. According to National Security Council
        spokesman John Kirby, Russia launched two strikes on Ukraine in the last
        week using missiles supplied by Pyongyang that have a range of about 900
        kilometers.
        <br />
        <br />
        During a briefing at the White House, Kirby informed reporters,
        &quot;Our information indicates that the Democratic People&apos;s
        Republic of Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missile
        launchers and several ballistic missiles.&quot; &quot;This is a major
        and worrisome increase in the DPRK&apos;s backing of Russia.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        The event demonstrated how urgently the US Congress must approve a
        package of crucial military aid for Ukraine, or else the supply of
        assistance will quickly run out, Kirby continued. He declared that
        Ukraine&apos;s air defenses were &quot;absolutely&quot; a priority,
        given that the country has recently been the target of numerous aerial
        attacks by Russia. Congress must convene immediately and act to give the
        Ukrainian people the tools they need to defend themselves.

            As it constitutes a violation of UN sanctions against North Korea,
            the US and its allies will now bring up the issue at the UN Security
            Council, according to Kirby. The use of North Korean missiles by
            Russia has drawn strong condemnation from Britain.
          </span>
          <span>
            &quot;Russia is pursuing its misguided and cynical military
            objectives in Ukraine by looking to North Korea for its armaments.
            This is an indication of its desperation and a symptom of its
            isolation on the international scene&quot;, according to a Foreign
            Office statement. It further stated that North Korea would pay a
            &quot;high price&quot; for breaking UN sanctions.
          </span>
          <span>
            According to Kirby, negotiations are ongoing to acquire close-range
            ballistic missiles, but no deal has been reached. Russia also plans
            to buy missiles from its ally Iran.
          </span>
          <span>
            Although it was the first time the US had acknowledged the use of
            such weapons, the US said in October that North Korea had shipped
            more than 1,000 containers filled with armaments and military
            hardware to Russia. After meeting with Putin in September in the far
            east of Russia, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un alarmed Kyiv&apos;s
            allies by raising the prospect of an arms deal.
          </span>
          <span>
            Following an unprecedented attack on the Russian city of Belgorod
            over the weekend, Putin, who began his invasion of Ukraine in
            February 2022, pledged to step up his sanctions against the country.
            According to Kyiv, the most recent attacks highlight the necessity
            for Western allies to expedite the delivery of long-range missiles,
            combat drones, and air defense systems.
          </span>
          <span>
            In his New Year&apos;s speech last week, Ukrainian President
            Volodymyr Zelensky threatened to exact &quot;wrath&quot; on Russian
            forces in 2024, a warning that Kyiv has increased domestic
            production.

        In a historic accomplishment, 13-year-old Willis Gibson, popularly known
        as &quot;blue scuti,&quot; has become the first person to reach the
        elusive &quot;kill screen&quot; in the Tetris game for Nintendo. Prior
        to this, it was believed that artificial intelligence could only
        accomplish this feat. Willis captured the intense moment when he pushed
        the iconic computer game to its limits in an engrossing over 40-minute
        video that was posted to YouTube this week, documenting his incredible
        feat.
        <br />
        <br />
        Willis&apos; video&apos;s poignant finale contrasts sharply with the
        preceding thirty-five minutes of intense gameplay. Despite his fast
        finger movements on the controller, the competitive gamer from Oklahoma
        handled the falling blocks with poise. The Tetris community, comprising
        players from both online and live tournaments, praised this historic
        achievement, describing it as something that many had previously thought
        was impossible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Vince Clemente, President of the Classic Tetris World Championship, said
        of Willis&apos; accomplishment, &quot;It&apos;s never been done by a
        human before.&quot; It is essentially something that, until a few years
        ago, everyone believed to be impossible.&quot; A Soviet software
        engineer created the game Tetris, which requires players to rotate and
        manipulate falling blocks to form solid lines inside of boxes. Players
        have tested the game&apos;s boundaries over time, finding ways to
        advance past what was initially thought to be the game&apos;s endpoint.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-xl">Cracking the code</span>
        <br />
        Because the blocks fell so quickly in Level 29, many people thought it
        was the last challenge in the game. But new developments in gameplay
        have made it possible for players to go beyond this point. When Willis
        got to Level 157 on December 21, he dropped a piece that set off a
        glitch that made the game freeze and a single line of blocks disappear.
        For the first time, a player who wasn&apos;t a computer made it to the
        elusive &quot;kill screen.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-xl">
          What is the &quot;kill screen&quot; in Tetris?
        </span>
        <br />
        In Tetris, the &quot;kill screen&quot; refers to a stage where an error
        occurs that stops the game from moving forward. On the Nintendo version,
        Willis Gibson became the first person to reach this milestone.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-xl">
          Why does Willis&apos; accomplishment matter?
        </span>
        <br />
        The accomplishment of Willis Gibson is noteworthy because he achieved a
        level in Tetris that was previously believed to be exclusive to
        artificial intelligence, setting new records.

        The U.S. Navy said that although a Houthi drone boat loaded with
        explosives exploded in the Red Sea on Thursday, it did not result in any
        damage or casualties. The Yemen-based group has been attacking despite
        calls from other countries to cease.
        <br />
        <br />
        The most recent attack occurred one day after a group of 12 nations,
        including the United States, Britain, and Japan, issued a statement
        warning the Houthis that there would be &quot;consequences&quot; if they
        continued their attacks. A U.S. official suggested on Wednesday that
        this was the last warning.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since November 19, the Houthis, who control a large portion of Yemen and
        are aligned with Iran, have been firing waves of rockets and drones at
        commercial ships in an apparent attempt to cause damage in response to
        Israel&apos;s military actions in Gaza.
        <br />
        <br />
        International shipping has been severely disrupted by the Houthi
        campaign; as a result, some companies have decided to forgo transits
        through the Red Sea in favor of the more expensive and time-consuming
        route around Africa.
        <br />
        <br />
        The head of U.S. naval forces in the Middle East, Vice Admiral Brad
        Cooper, informed reporters on Thursday that the Houthi explosive boat
        penetrated about 50 miles (80 km) into the Red Sea before exploding in
        crowded shipping lanes.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;We all watched as it exploded, coming within a couple of miles of
        ships operating in the area, merchant ships and U.S. Navy ships,&quot;
        Cooper said reporters, adding that it was unclear what the attack&apos;s
        precise target was.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cooper stated that &quot;there are no signs that their irresponsible
        behavior is abating.&quot; The Houthis have now launched 25 attacks
        against merchant vessels that are navigating the southern Red Sea and
        the Gulf of Aden.
        <br />
        <br />
        President Joe Biden is under more pressure to respond militarily as a
        result of the ongoing Houthi attacks, but his administration has been
        hesitant to do so for fear of worsening the already high levels of
        tension in the region.

        Dozens of &quot;fake&quot; websites and mobile applications that purport

        subject of an investigation by the Delhi Police. Although no one has
        been taken into custody as of yet, police stated that they have combined

        Cybercrime Reporting Portal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Police said on Tuesday that they had filed a formal complaint against a
        cryptocurrency investment company. The platform CoinDCX is mentioned in
        the last-month-registered FIR.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, CoinDCX stated that the current situation involved
        &quot;fraudulent websites/URLs&quot; impersonating the CoinDCX exchange.
        <br />
        <br />
        When a 24-year-old Chattarpur engineer tried to withdraw the nearly Rs
        14 lakh he had invested using the app last month, he was prompted to
        transfer an additional Rs 4.65 lakh, from which tax would be withheld.
        Additional complainants claimed they were &quot;forced&quot; to pay more
        in order to receive a refund.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the company, the incident was the result of a phony website
        scam and had nothing to do with the CoinDCX app or website.
        &quot;It&apos;s important to note that a number of fraudulent websites
        and URLs are posing as financial apps in an attempt to trick users—a
        problem that many fintech companies and financial applications,
        including cryptocurrency apps, must deal with. We have quickly notified
        CERT of these threats. A company spokesperson stated, &quot;Our
        compliance team met with representatives from MeiTY and I4C, gave them
        the list of misleading websites, and we are asking for their help in
        taking them down. The company went on to say that over 100 phony
        profiles had been made using its name in an attempt to trick investors
        and users.
        <br />
        <br />
        An officer stated, &quot;We haven&apos;t received an official complaint
        from the firm yet. We have received complaints about Telegram channels
        and phony cryptocurrency platforms. We filed FIRs and will look into the
        situation. Many cryptocurrency portals and platforms defraud people who
        invest in Bitcoin. People take advantage of the lack of regulations
        surrounding cryptocurrencies and defraud investors.&quot;

        The accused, 45-year-old scrap dealer Ravi Nagar, also known as Ravi
        Kana, and his gang, are being targeted by Gautam Buddha Nagar Police,
        following a complaint filed by a 25-year-old woman claiming she was
        gangraped in the Gardens Galleria Mall parking lot in June of last year.
        Teams have been assembled to apprehend Kana, but on Wednesday, the
        Greater Noida police sealed his properties, which are valued at Rs 100
        crore.
        <br />
        <br />
        The woman claimed she was threatened by the accused and was unable to
        file the complaint until December 30. The men used the guise of a job to
        entice her. She went to the police when they began using the
        incident&apos;s videos as blackmail. Kana was one of five men named in a
        gangrape lawsuit. There are three men in custody: Rajkumar Nagar, Azad
        Nagar, and Vikas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Following this incident, police began investigating Kana&apos;s other
        endeavors. The UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act,
        1986 has been used to charge Kana, his gang members, and his wife, per
        the directives of Gautam Buddha Nagar Police Commissioner Laxmi Singh.
        Anil was the man who was arrested in this instance.
        <br />
        <br />
        A combined team from the Beta 2 and Ecotech 1 police stations raided
        factories connected to Kana on Tuesday, according to DCP (Greater Noida)
        Saad Miya Khan. Raids at Shri Krishna Steels and Prime Processing Tools
        Private Limited resulted in the sealing of 20 empty trucks, 10 computers
        with printers, 3 motorcycles, 2 tractors, and 2 trucks loaded with
        scrap. The sealed scrap material and additional items are valued at
        approximately Rs 100 crore. Khan stated, &quot;The other accused in the
        case will be arrested shortly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kana used to work illegally as a scrap dealer for Anil Dujana, a
        notorious gangster. However, weeks prior to Dujana&apos;s death in an
        altercation with UP Police in May of last year, the two had a falling
        out.
        <br />
        <br />
        It should be noted that following the shooting death of his brother
        Harendra Pradhan in Greater Noida in February 2015, Kana was placed
        under police protection. &quot;On July 25, 2023, his security was
        removed following an investigation,&quot; stated Ashok Kumar, ADCP
        (Greater Noida).
        <br />
        <br />
        According to officials, Kana&apos;s gang would obstruct trucks that were
        en route to construction sites and, working with the drivers, unload
        rebar at a predetermined spot. &quot;They gained unjustified financial
        advantages by offering traders rebar at market value. Additionally, by
        threatening business owners, they would secure contracts for scrap
        material at the desired rate, according to a senior police officer.

        After being detained for almost seven years in relation to a
        gangster&apos;s murder case, Divya Pahuja was free on bond.
        <br />
        <br />
        On Wednesday, Divya Pahuja, a 27-year-old woman suspected of being
        involved in the purportedly staged encounter with notorious gangster
        Sandeep Gadoli, was shot and killed in a hotel room close to the
        Gurugram bus stop.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pahuja, a resident of Sector-7 in Gurugram&apos;s Baldev Nagar, was free
        on bond following nearly seven years of detention in relation to
        Gadoli&apos;s death. On February 7, 2016, the gangster was killed in a
        Mumbai hotel. Pahuja, her mother, and five police officers were taken
        into custody in connection with the gangster&apos;s murder.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the Mumbai Police, Gadoli&apos;s girlfriend Pahuja assisted
        the police officers in luring him into the hotel. In addition, the
        police claimed that Virendra Kumar, also known as Binder Gujjar, was the
        leader of an opposing gang and had plotted Gadoli&apos;s death with
        Haryana Police officers.

        NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) leader Jitendra Awhad questioned how Lord
        Ram, a vegetarian, could have survived in the jungle for fourteen years.
        <br />
        <br />
        The BJP has demanded that January 22, the day of the consecration of the
        Ram Temple in Ayodhya, be declared a dry day and that all non-vegetarian
        food be banned. Maharashtra leader Jitendra Awhad&apos;s remark that
        Lord Ram was never a vegetarian because he couldn&apos;t live in the
        jungle for 14 years as a vegetarian has sparked a major controversy in
        the state. According to the Nationalist Congress Party MLA (Sharad Pawar
        faction), Lord Ram was a hunter and a Bahujan who did not follow a
        vegetarian diet. &quot;We forget everything in politics and don&apos;t
        read history. We own Ram. Of us Bahujans. Who used to hunt to eat… Ram
        was never a vegetarian. He was a non-vegetarian&quot;. Jitendra Awhad
        questioned &quot;how a man who spent 14 years living in the bush could
        continue to be a vegetarian&quot;.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shiv Sena&apos;s Saamana newspaper would have criticized the &apos;Ram
        non-vegetarian&apos; remark if Balasaheb Thackeray had been alive,
        according to BJP MLA Ram Kadam. &quot;But in the actual world of today,
        the Uddhav Sena does not seem to mind if someone makes fun of Hindus.
        They are apathetic and as frigid as ice. However, they will bring up
        Hindutva when the election time comes.&quot; Thursday, Ram Kadam posted
        a tweet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ram Kadam demanded in a letter to Chief Minister Eknath Shinde that
        January 22 be set aside as a vegetarian and dry day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jitendra Awhad responded to the controversy his remark caused by asking,
        &quot;What is the controversy about what did Lord Ram eat? There was no
        rice back then, but someone will say that Lord Ram used to eat
        methi-bhaji, or fritters made from fenugreek leaves. Because Kshatriyas
        are not vegetarians, Lord Ram was a Kshatriya. I wholeheartedly support
        what I said. In addition to being non-vegetarians, 80% of Indians are
        followers of Lord Ram&quot;, Jitendra Awhad said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Priest Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of Shri Ram Janambhoomi
        Teerth Kshetra, refuted Awhad&apos;s claim, stating that scriptures
        record that Lord Ram ate fruits when he was in exile. &quot;Jitendra
        Awhad, the leader of the NCP, is saying things that are wholly untrue.
        Nowhere in our scriptures is it mentioned that Lord Ram ate
        non-vegetarian food while he was in exile. It states that he once
        consumed fruits. It is not right for such a liar to disparage our Lord
        Ram. Our God was a vegetarian from the beginning. He is insulting our
        Lord Ram by using derogatory language,&quot; the priest remarked.

        The names of friends and inner circle members of disgraced financier and
        sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away in jail in 2019 while
        awaiting federal sex-trafficking charges, were revealed in nearly 1,000
        pages of court records that had previously been redacted. The records
        were unsealed on Wednesday. The expected revelations have generated a
        lot of buzz and speculation. CNN reported on what is known about the
        documents and why they are important.

          <span className="text-xl">Jeffrey Epstein: who was he?</span>
          <span>
            Epstein, a multimillionaire known for his connections to
            politicians, celebrities, billionaires, and elite academics, was
            first detained in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2005 on suspicion of
            paying a 14-year-old girl for sex. However, in 2008, prosecutors
            permitted him to enter a guilty plea to a charge pertaining to a
            single victim. He participated in a jail work-release program for 13
            months.
          </span>
          <span>
            There were allegations of similar sexual abuse from dozens of other
            minor girls. While many of his well-known acquaintances, including
            former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, abandoned Epstein
            after his conviction, many others did not. For ten more years,
            Epstein remained in the company of the wealthy and well-known,
            frequently through charitable endeavors.
          </span>
          <span>
            In 2019, Epstein was charged with sex trafficking by federal
            prosecutors in New York due to renewed interest in the scandal
            following Miami Herald reporting. While in custody awaiting trial,
            he committed suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein&apos;s
            ex-girlfriend, was subsequently charged by the US attorney in
            Manhattan for aiding in the recruitment of his minor victims.
            According to Guardian, she was found guilty in 2021 and is currently
            incarcerated for 20 years.

            What is the subject matter of these records?
          </span>
          <span>
            The documents that are being made public are a part of a lawsuit
            that Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein&apos;s victims, filed against
            Maxwell in 2015. Giuffre was one of Epstein&apos;s victims who sued
            him, claiming that he had mistreated her at his homes in Florida,
            New York, the US Virgin Islands, and New Mexico. When Giuffre turned
            seventeen, she said, she was enticed to leave her position as a spa
            attendant at Trump&apos;s Mar-a-Lago club in order to work as a
            &quot;masseuse&quot; for Epstein, which involved engaging in sexual
            acts.
          </span>
          <span>
            She further claimed that she was coerced into having sex with Prince
            Andrew of Britain and other men in Epstein&apos;s social circle. Her
            accounts were refuted by all the accused men as being false. In
            2022, Giuffre and Prince Andrew reached a settlement in court. She
            retracted her accusation against law professor Alan Dershowitz,
            Epstein&apos;s former attorney, in the same year, saying she
            &quot;may have made a mistake&quot; in designating him as an abuser.
          </span>
          <span>
            Despite the fact that Giuffre and Maxwell&apos;s lawsuit was
            resolved in 2017, the Miami Herald requested judicial intervention
            in order to obtain court documents that had been initially filed
            under seal, including transcripts of attorney-client interviews with
            possible witnesses. A court unsealed about 2,000 pages in 2019, and
            more documents surfaced in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The privacy rights
            of Epstein&apos;s victims and other people whose names surfaced
            during the legal battle but who were not involved in his crimes had
            caused this next batch of records to stay sealed.

        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">What is contained in the files?</span>
          <span>
            US District Judge Loretta A. Preska evaluated the documents to
            decide what should be unsealed. She made the decision to release the
            records in December, stating that a large portion of the information
            contained therein was already known to the public. In other court
            cases, some records have been made public, either in full or in
            part. A large portion of the remaining material deals with subjects
            and characters that have been thoroughly covered in newspaper
            articles, TV documentaries, books, interviews, and testimony during
            Maxwell&apos;s criminal trial over the course of nearly 20 years.
          </span>
          <span>
            Numerous accusers of Epstein, staff members who told tabloid
            newspapers about their experiences, witnesses at Maxwell&apos;s
            trial, people mentioned in passing during depositions but not
            implicated in any scandalous activities, and investigators of
            Epstein, including prosecutors, a journalist, and a detective, are
            among the names listed in the records. The judge added that there
            are also prominent figures&apos; names in boldface who are known to
            have had relationships with Epstein over the years, but whose
            relationships have already been thoroughly reported elsewhere.
          </span>
          <span>
            Among them is Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent who was close
            to Epstein and committed suicide in a Paris jail in 2022 while
            awaiting trial on allegations that he had sexually assaulted minors.
            Among the women who had accused Brunel of sexual abuse was Giuffre.
            Both Trump and Clinton are mentioned in the court file, in part
            because Giuffre was questioned by Maxwell&apos;s attorneys regarding
            errors in press articles regarding her time spent with Epstein,
            according to the Guardian.
          </span>
          <span>
            She was cited in one story as saying that she flirted with Trump and
            went on a helicopter ride with Clinton. According to Giuffre, none
            of those events occurred in reality. She doesn&apos;t seem to have
            implicated any of the former presidents. The judge stated that
            certain names ought to be kept off the records since they would
            identify victims of sexual abuse.
          </span>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">
            Why is everyone&apos;s attention focused on new documents?
          </span>
          <span>
            The high-profile associates are what have drawn attention to the
            latest revelation in the documents. Federal Judge Loretta Preska in
            Manhattan unsealed the documents, which included the names of
            numerous people identified as associates, affiliates, or victims of
            Epstein in a civil lawsuit filed in 2015.
          </span>
          <span>
            According to US-based NPR, the documents contain references to a
            number of people, including former Vice President Al Gore, magician
            David Copperfield, actor Kevin Spacey, lawyer Alan Dershowitz, late
            New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, and former Israeli Prime
            Minister Ehud Barak.
          </span>
          <span></span>
          <span></span>
        </div>
        The inclusion of names in these documents does not imply that any of the
        individuals are the subject of accusations or proof of wrongdoing.Due to
        earlier court cases or media revelations, a large number of the most
        well-known people—including American politicians, members of British
        royalty, tech tycoons, and bankers—were already known to be connected to
        Epstein. The majority of those who have been made public have denied any
        misconduct or prior knowledge of Epstein&apos;s illegal actions.

        Given that police and prosecutors are currently dealing with a massive
        backlog of real rape cases, the inquiry into the historic case has
        raised concerns about whether police should be pursuing virtual
        offenses.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first case of alleged rape in a virtual reality game is being looked
        into by UK police after a 16-year-old girl was &quot;sexually
        attacked&quot; in the online &quot;metaverse&quot;. According to The New
        York, the girl was left upset when strangers she met online gang-raped
        her avatar, or virtual character. According to the report, the teen was
        playing an immersive virtual reality game when she was allegedly raped
        by several men. Investigating officers claimed that despite her lack of
        physical harm, she experienced the same emotional and psychological
        trauma as someone who has been sexually assaulted in the &quot;real
        world.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        It is thought that this is the first virtual sexual offense that the
        police have looked into. &quot;Psychological trauma suffered by this
        child is comparable to that of a person who has been sexually assaulted.
        Longer-lasting than any physical wounds are the emotional and
        psychological effects on the victim, a senior officer with knowledge of
        the case told the news outlet. &quot;It poses a number of challenges for
        law enforcement given current legislation is not set up for this,&quot;
        said the officer.
        <br />
        <br />
        What game the teenage girl was playing at the time of the alleged
        offense is still unknown, though. Given that police and prosecutors are
        currently dealing with a massive backlog of real rape cases, the inquiry
        into the historic case has raised concerns about whether police should
        be pursuing virtual offenses.
        <br />
        <br />
        James Cleverly, the UK&apos;s home secretary, has defended the virtual
        reality rape investigation, claiming that the child has experienced
        &quot;sexual trauma&quot;. Mr. Cleverly told news outlet LBC, &quot;I
        know it is easy to dismiss this as being not real, but the whole point
        of these virtual environments is they are incredibly immersive.&quot;
        &quot;It&apos;s also worth realising that somebody who is willing to put
        a child through a trauma like that digitally may well be someone that
        could go on to do terrible things in the physical realm.&quot;

        The government has canceled the nationwide truckers&apos; strike,
        promising to consult all relevant parties before enacting a
        controversial anti-hit-and-run law. The All-India Motor Transport
        Congress decided to end the agitation after extensive negotiations with
        the government.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;We had a conversation with representatives of the All India Motor
        Transport Congress... the administration wishes to clarify that the new
        regulation has not yet been put into effect. Union Home Secretary Ajay
        Bhalla stated this evening, &quot;We all want to say that before
        implementing Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita 106/2, we will have a discussion
        with representatives of the All India Motor Transport Congress and only
        then will we take a decision.&quot; The new legislation isn&apos;t yet
        in effect. The All India Transport Congress will only be consulted
        before it is implemented, as confirmed by Bal Malkit, the head of the
        AIMTC&apos;s core committee.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Indian Penal Code from the colonial era was to be replaced by the
        Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita, or BNS, which has strict penalties for
        hit-and-run incidents. This is why there was protest over Section 106(2)
        of the BNS. There was fear of an all-India truckers strike due to a
        shortage of fuel and other necessities. Many states, including Jammu and
        Kashmir, Bihar, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh,
        and Chhattisgarh, had witnessed the protests.
        <br />
        <br />
        The previous penalty for hit-and-run incidents was up to two years in
        jail and a lesser fine; under the new law, the maximum sentence is ten
        years in jail and a fine of ₹ 7 lakh. When someone causes death by
        reckless driving and leaves the scene without calling the police, they
        will be sentenced to a maximum of ten years in prison.
        <br />
        <br />
        Drivers of commercial vehicles, such as cabbies and truckers, are
        wondering how they would afford to pay such a high fine in the event of
        an accident. The potential for legal abuse, the procedure for alerting
        authorities due to the possibility of public outrage, and the type of
        evidence that will be accepted in the event of a dispute are all
        concerns raised by experts.

        Japanese investigators on Wednesday probed a near-catastrophic collision
        at Tokyo&apos;s Haneda Airport between a coast guard plane and a
        passenger jet that airline executives have said was given permission to
        land.
        <br />
        <br />
        Five people on the coast guard aircraft died, but all 379 passengers and
        crew escaped to safety down emergency slides minutes before the Japan
        Airlines Airbus was engulfed in flames late Tuesday. The burned-out husk
        of the airliner, still sitting on the tarmac Wednesday, bore witness to
        just how narrow their escape had been. The captain of the coast guard
        plane -- which had been carrying aid to the New Year&apos;s Day
        earthquake zone -- was its lone survivor but suffered serious injuries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Footage on Tuesday showed a ball of fire erupting and thick black smoke
        from underneath the airliner shortly after landing and coming to a halt
        on its nose after its front landing gear failed. Passengers could be
        seen sliding down inflatable slides as flames shot out from the rear of
        the aircraft in video posted to social media platform X. As the plane
        was evacuated, dozens of fire engines with blue and red flashing lights
        tried to douse the flames but the entire plane was soon engulfed and it
        took eight hours to finally extinguish the blaze.
        <br />
        <br />
        Landing clearance Government officials pledged to investigate how the
        incident happened in a country that had not seen a serious commercial
        aviation accident for decades. Asked at a briefing late Tuesday night
        whether the Japan Airlines flight had secured landing permission from
        air traffic control, officials at the major carrier said: &quot;Our
        understanding is that it was given.&quot; But JAL and the land ministry
        declined to comment directly on exchanges between flight controllers and
        the two planes, citing the ongoing investigation. In a recording from
        Haneda&apos;s control tower apparently taken in the moments before the
        collision, available on a site that broadcasts live air traffic signals,
        a voice can be heard advising JAL&apos;s flight to &quot;continue
        approach&quot;.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some domestic flights were operating on Wednesday morning from Haneda,
        one of the world&apos;s busiest airports, but dozens were cancelled.
        France&apos;s Airbus, which manufactured the JAL plane, said it would
        send a team of specialists to help Japanese authorities investigate. The
        passenger plane had arrived from New Chitose Airport serving Sapporo on
        the northern island of Hokkaido. Those on board included eight children.
        <br />
        <br />
        The coast guard plane had been preparing to fly to Ishikawa prefecture
        to deliver supplies after the devastating New Year&apos;s Day earthquake
        that killed at least 62 people. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida praised the
        dead crew members on their way to help the victims of the quake.

        A ₹ 799 registration fee was required of the interested men. The group
        gave them some pictures after they registered and asked them to select
        the woman they wanted to get pregnant.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Bihar, eight people have been taken into custody for allegedly paying
        men ₹ 13 lakh to get women who were infertile pregnant.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the police, the ring was operated under the name &quot;All
        India Pregnant Job Service&quot;.
        <br />
        <br />
        The arrests took place in Nawada, Bihar. According to the police, the
        accused would reach out to men on social media and WhatsApp, offering
        them the chance to make thousands of rupees in exchange for their
        &quot;service&quot;. A ₹ 799 registration fee was required of the
        interested men. The group gave them some pictures after they registered
        and asked them to select the woman they wanted to get pregnant.
        Afterwards, a security deposit of ₹ 5 to ₹ 20,000 was requested of them,
        depending on how &quot;attractive the woman was.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;The men were informed that should the woman become pregnant, they
        would receive ₹ 13 lakh. Superintendent of Police in Nawada Kalyan Anand
        stated, &quot;They were promised a consolation price of ₹ 5 lakh even if
        they failed to impregnate the woman.&quot; Following a raid in Nawada by
        a Bihar police Special Investigation Team (SIT), the arrests were made.
        Officials stated that police have located cell phones and a printer on
        the premises and that they are still looking for the other suspects,
        including the mastermind.

        The districts magistrate issued an order that stated, &quot;The curfew
        relaxation order dated December 31 stands cancelled and full curfew is
        imposed in all areas of Imphal West district with immediate effect due
        to developing law and order condition in the district and to prevent any
        untoward incidents and loss of life and property, and further as a
        precautionary measure.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        Curfews were also reinstated in the districts of Thoubal, Imphal East,
        Kakching, and Bishnupur.

        Chief Minister N Biren Singh promised that &quot;the perpetrators would
        be found in a video statement, despite the lack of information
        surrounding the incident. We take this incident very seriously. The
        Manipur police are working hard to find the offenders. I beg everyone,
        especially those in Lilong, to abstain from using any kind of violence.
        I promise that we will enforce the law and take tough measures against
        the offenders. Kindly assist the authorities,&quot; he said.

        According to officials cited by PTI, the as-yet-unidentified gunmen
        arrived disguised as locals and started shooting. Hospitalized are five
        more injured individuals. A few cars were set on fire by angry locals
        following the attack. Three Manipur Police commandos were hurt on
        Saturday night, a few days prior, when an RPG attack occurred at one of
        their posts in the border town of Moreh. According to officials,
        suspected militants are thought to be responsible for the attack.

        More than 180 people have been killed and several hundred injured since
        ethnic violence between the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities broke out
        in Manipur on May 3. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of
        Manipur&apos;s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals
        — Nagas and Kukis — constitute little over 40 per cent and reside in the
        hill districts.

        A series of strong earthquakes struck Japan on Monday, causing tsunami
        waves to rise as high as five feet. Local media reported that in
        response, authorities sent out evacuation advisories and tsunami
        warnings to people living along the nation&apos;s northwest coast.
        <br />
        <br />
        The earthquake affected Ishikawa and its surrounding prefectures,
        according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), with one prefecture
        recording an initial magnitude of 7.6, as reported by The Associated
        Press. Following the earthquake, local weather agencies predicted that
        there would be tsunami waves within 300 kilometers of the Noto,
        Ishigawa, epicenter.
        <br />
        <br />
        At 4:06 PM local time, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake sparked the seismic
        activity. Subsequently, at 4:10 PM, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake, at 4:18
        PM, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake, at 4:23 PM local time, a 4.5 magnitude
        event, at 4:29 PM local time, and at 4:32 PM local time, a 4.6 magnitude
        earthquake.
        <br />
        <br />
        People facing a tsunami of more than one meter in height were
        &quot;highly likely to be unable to stand, with the possibility of
        death&quot;, according to a warning issued by the Japan Meteorological
        Agency (JMA), as reported by The Japan Times. The Japan Meteorological
        Agency (JMA) issued tsunami warnings along the western coasts of the
        prefectures of Ishikawa, Niigata, and Toyama, according to Reuters.
        According to NHK, waves in other prefectures such as Niigata and Toyama
        reached three meters in height.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many videos that have been going viral on social media show individuals
        being forced to shelter under tables and chairs as buildings tremble
        violently. Meanwhile powerful tsunami waves posed an immediate threat to
        coastal areas. The earthquake activity caused severe damage to
        surrounding roadways and fractures in them, resulting in the collapse of
        numerous dwellings.

        According to INSACOG&apos;s data updated on Monday, 196 cases of
        COVID-19 sub-variant JN.1 have been found in the country to date, with
        Odisha entering the list of states that have detected the variant&apos;s
        presence.
        <br />
        <br />
        The JN.1 sub-variant of the virus has been found in ten states and Union
        territories thus far. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium
        (INSACOG) lists these states as follows: Kerala (83), Goa (51), Gujarat
        (34), Karnataka (eight), Maharashtra (seven), Rajasthan (five), Tamil
        Nadu (four), Telangana (two), Odisha (one), and Delhi (one).
        <br />
        <br />
        According to INSACOG data, JN.1 was found in 179 out of the 179 Covid
        cases that were reported nationwide in December; the remaining 17 cases
        had this detection in November. Despite its fast spreading nature, the
        World Health Organization (WHO) has designated JN.1 as a distinct
        &quot;variant of interest&quot; and stated that it presents a
        &quot;low&quot; danger to global public health.
        <br />
        <br />
        The international body stated that the JN.1 sub-variant of the
        coronavirus was previously categorized as a variation of interest (VOI)
        as a component of the parent lineage that is categorized as a VOI, the
        BA.2.86 sub-lineages. Nonetheless, JN.1 cases have been recorded from
        several nations in recent weeks, and the virus&apos;s incidence has
        risen sharply worldwide.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to an increase in Covid cases and the discovery of the JN.1
        sub-variant in the nation, the Center has requested that the states and
        Union territories keep a continuous watch. India now has 636 new
        coronavirus infections, while there are 4,394 ongoing cases, according
        to data released on Monday by the Health ministry.

        Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the brutal murder of Punjabi
        singer Sidhu Moosewala, was on Monday declared a designated terrorist by
        the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).
        <br />
        <br />
        A key member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Brar had claimed
        responsibility for the murder of Moosewala, who was killed in a hail of
        bullets in Punjab&apos;s Mansa district on May 29, 2022. A native of
        Faridkot in Punjab, Brar, whose real name is Satinderjit Singh, went to
        Canada on a student visa in 2017.
        <br />
        <br />
        While claiming responsibility for Mooosewala&apos;s murder, Brar had
        said in a Facebook post, “Sachin Bishnoi Dhattaranwali, Lawrence
        Bishnoi, and I are behind the killing of Sidhu Moosewala.” The gangster
        had claimed that he killed Moosewala to avenge the death of Youth Akali
        Dal leader Vicky Middukhera.
        <br />
        <br />
        Brar had also claimed responsibility for the murder of Dera follower
        Pardeep Singh Kataria in Kotkapura in 2022. An accused in the 2015
        Bargari sacrilege case, Kataria was out on bail and was shot dead at his
        shop by a group of six men on November 11 that year. Brar is also
        allegedly involved in an extortion racket being run in Punjab and is
        believed to have had a hand in the murder of Youth Congress leader
        Gurlal Pehalwan.

        After a 21-minute flight, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)
        launched the X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat), its first polarimetry
        mission, into an exact circular orbit of 650 km on Monday morning,
        January 1.
        <br />
        <br />
        The second satellite-based mission in the world devoted to measuring
        X-ray polarimetry is known as XPoSat. India&apos;s first mission to
        analyze the polarization of X-rays emitted from bright celestial sources
        in the medium frequency band is called X-ray Polarimeter Satellite
        (XPoSat). Indian X-ray Polarimeter (POLIX) and X-ray Spectroscopy and
        Timing (XSPECT) are the two payloads that make up XPoSat. The Raman
        Research Institute and the UR Rao Satellite Centre, both in Bengaluru,
        are the organizations that constructed them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Low earth orbit (about 650 km, with a low inclination of about 6
        degrees) is the designated observational orbit for the spacecraft.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the course of its projected five-year mission, XPoSat will observe
        sources that produce polarized X-rays. The observations will take place,
        for example, during the eclipse period, when the magnetars, also known
        as neutron stars, are passing through the Earth&apos;s shadow. These
        stars are extremely magnetic and exhibit a wide range of X-ray activity.

        We should anticipate an even greater level of artificial intelligence
        being incorporated into our daily lives. It might end up in everything,
        including laptops and cellphones, and be used to personalize webpages

        <br />
        Visualize artificial intelligence (AI) as a being that exists solely on
        the knowledge that humans have accumulated over thousands of years. This
        is a technology that is all-pervasive and will soon become commonplace.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is the most advanced technology ever developed, and it gets
        stronger every second. Because of this, the past year has been
        extraordinary; never before have technological advancements and
        everything related to them changed so swiftly that it is now challenging
        to predict our future.
