          In North Delhi, a tragic incident occurred on the night between Monday
          and Tuesday, resulting in the death of a 40-year-old man and injuries
          to four others when his car collided head-on with another vehicle near
          the Geeta Colony Flyover.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a Delhi Police official, preliminary findings suggest
          that the accident occurred due to poor visibility on the road, and
          they were notified about the incident at 1:30 am.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collision occurred on Salim Garg Road near Jheel Cut, just before
          the Geeta Colony Flyover in the Kotwali area, as reported by Manoj
          Kumar Meena, DCP (North). At the scene, both vehicles, a Celerio and a
          Swift, both displaying license plates, were found significantly
          damaged.

          Upon initial investigation, it was revealed that the Celerio was
          struck by the Swift from the opposite carriageway, causing substantial
          damage to the central road divider. The driver of the Swift,
          identified as Gaurav Malhotra from Laxmi Nagar, lost his life in the
          collision.
        </p>
        <p>
          DCP Meena further stated, &quot;Four other individuals, namely Sumi,
          Saurav, and two unidentified persons, sustained injuries. One of them
          is in critical condition and has been admitted to the Trauma Centre. A
          case has been registered against unknown persons under the sections of
          causing death due to negligence and rash driving of the IPC (Indian
          Penal Code).&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic incident highlights the dangerous consequences of the
          collision, with one fatality and multiple individuals grappling with
          injuries. The authorities are actively investigating the case,
          focusing on potential negligence and reckless driving as contributing
          factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This unfortunate event serves as a somber reminder of the importance
          of road safety and the need for heightened awareness, especially
          during periods of low visibility. As the investigation unfolds,
          authorities will likely seek to determine the exact circumstances
          leading to the collision and hold those responsible accountable for
          the tragic outcome.

          The film, produced and distributed by Sony Pictures Films India
          Private Limited, featuring Mrunal Thakur, Abhimanyu Dassai, and Paresh
          Rawal, was released in November of the preceding year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dehadrai argued that the entire film contained highly offensive
          references, describing it as a comedy with an exceptionally
          distasteful portrayal of individuals with permanent disabilities. He
          emphasized that the film perpetuated negative stereotypes, deviating
          from its intended comedic nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these claims, the Delhi High Court declined to entertain the
          plea. The court&apos;s decision signifies a legal stance against the
          petitioner&apos;s argument that the film violated the rights of
          individuals with disabilities, as outlined in the RPwD Act. The
          court&apos;s rejection implies that, based on their evaluation, the
          film does not appear to infringe upon the legal provisions intended to
          protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This legal development highlights the challenges in navigating the
          intersection of artistic expression and potential societal impact,
          especially when it comes to sensitive subjects like disabilities.
          While the petitioner raised concerns about offensive portrayals and
          perpetuation of negative stereotypes in the film, the court&apos;s
          decision signals a subjective interpretation of the content within the
          framework of existing laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          As debates around creative freedom and responsible representation in
          the entertainment industry continue, legal cases like these underscore
          the importance of finding a balance between artistic expression and
          ensuring that content does not compromise the dignity and rights of
          specific communities. The court&apos;s decision serves as a precedent
          in addressing such concerns within the evolving landscape of media and
          entertainment law.

          In anticipation of unemployment emerging as a pivotal issue in the
          upcoming 2024 elections, the Sangh Parivar is actively steering the
          narrative away from mere job seeking. Over the past two years, a
          concerted effort has been made to emphasize self-employment and guide
          young individuals in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In sync with the government&apos;s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the
          Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) launched its Swavalambi Bharat
          Abhiyan on January 12, 2022. This initiative, led by the economic wing
          of the RSS, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), aims to inspire youth to
          become entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last two years, the SJM and affiliated organizations within
          the RSS have organized 4,413 programs across 511 districts, involving
          over 82,000 youths, collaborating with 400 industrial units, and
          honoring 3,938 entrepreneurs. Additionally, 448 Zilla Rozgar Kendras
          (district employment centers) have been established to assist young
          entrepreneurs in securing funds, arranging necessary training,
          providing legal guidance, and facilitating government clearances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ashwani Mahajan, the national co-convenor of SJM, underscores the need
          to shift the mindset from job-seeking, attributing the inclination
          towards government jobs to policies initiated by Jawaharlal Nehru.
          Mahajan contends that with millions entering the job market annually,
          neither the government nor multinational corporations can provide
          employment opportunities for everyone. The solution, according to him,
          lies in fostering entrepreneurship and revitalizing India&apos;s
          historical legacy as a land of entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of their strategy, the SJM has conducted Entrepreneur
          Development Programs in 2,701 high schools and intermediate colleges,
          1,555 institutions and colleges, and 155 universities. The focus is on
          nurturing the risk-taking ability of young individuals by sharing
          success stories of fellow entrepreneurs and facilitating fund-raising
          through various channels such as private equity funds, government bank
          loans, and Mudra loans. The SJM aims to create an ecosystem that
          sustains entrepreneurial growth with collaboration from diverse
          sections, including politicians and corporates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous organizations affiliated with the Sangh Parivar, such as the
          Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Laghu Udyog Bharti,
          and others, are actively involved in this endeavor. External
          contributors include Zoho Corporation, Gayatri Parivar, Kaneri Math,
          and several more, showcasing a wide-ranging collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahajan highlights the establishment of numerous entrepreneurial
          ventures, including tailoring centers, beauty parlors, computer
          centers, Krishi Vikas Kendras, and Farmer Producer Organizations
          (FPOs) across the country over the past two years. To complement these
          efforts, the SJM has published multiple books on the theme of
          self-employment and even released a song titled &quot;Hum sabko aage
          badhna hai&quot; (We all have to advance), sung by playback artist
          Kailash Kher. The multifaceted approach aims to foster a culture of
          entrepreneurship and address the challenges posed by unemployment.

          In Karnataka&apos;s Haveri district, two men affiliated with a group
          accused of assaulting a Muslim woman and a Hindu man on January 8 are
          facing fresh charges in an assault case involving a 19-year-old woman
          in the same area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 19-year-old Muslim woman experienced an assault by these men,
          accompanied by three others, in the first week of January. The
          incident came to light after police discovered videos of the attack.
          In the January 8 incident at a hotel in Hanagal, the accused recorded
          a video of their assault on the interfaith couple, circulating it on
          social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yallappa Hiraganavar, an officer from the Hanagal police station,
          filed a complaint against Aftab Maqbool Ahmed, a 24-year-old mechanic,
          and Mardansab Mohammed Isaq Mandakki, a 23-year-old merchant, along
          with three others—Mehaboob Ali Gaffarsab Savikeri, Sahib Channapur,
          and Tanveer Gouda, all residents of Hanagal—for attacking the
          19-year-old woman. Ahmed and Mandakki are already in police custody
          over the January 8 attack and the alleged gangrape of a 26-year-old
          married Muslim woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a new police complaint registered on January 14 at the
          Hanagal police station, the 19-year-old woman was allegedly abducted
          by the gang on January 4 between 12 noon and 3 pm after she got off a
          bus. The gang purportedly outraged the modesty of the young woman and
          threatened her with dire consequences if she spoke out about the
          attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the complaint, the gang is said to have interrogated her about a
          man she was traveling with on the bus and whether she had willingly
          gone with him. They recorded a video of the moral policing incident
          and shared it on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, between January 10 and 14, Haveri police arrested seven men
          in connection with the January 8 assault case. Anshu Kumar,
          Superintendent of Police, Haveri, confirmed these arrests during a
          press briefing on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial FIR in the case was filed on January 10 by the Hanagal
          police, prompted by a room boy at the Idigas Lodge. The interfaith
          couple had refrained from filing a complaint due to fears of
          repercussions from their spouses.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, during a court appearance, the woman stated that she was also
          raped by the gang, who took her away after storming into their hotel
          room. The police subsequently invoked charges of gang rape against the
          accused based on the woman’s allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the seven men arrested for the January 8 incident is an
          autorickshaw driver named Abdul Khadar Jaffarsab, 28, who reportedly
          served as an informant to the gang about the interfaith couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police are investigating if some of the accused are involved in
          additional attacks on women under the guise of moral policing in the
          region. The accused have allegedly recorded videos of their assaults
          and shared them on social media, prompting the police to suspect that
          they may have been engaged in such crimes in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          These moral policing incidents, typically associated with right-wing
          groups in coastal Karnataka, have taken a political turn in Haveri.
          BJP leaders have criticized the ruling Congress government, with
          former chief minister and senior BJP leader Basavaraj Bommai, who
          hails from Haveri, alleging double standards in the state
          government&apos;s approach to tackling moral policing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bommai has demanded the creation of a Special Investigation Team to
          look into these cases and has accused the police of attempting to
          downplay the case by taking down a statement that did not include
          gangrape allegations. The situation raises concerns about the
          prevalence of moral policing, the safety of individuals in the region,
          and the effectiveness of the current legal system in ensuring justice
          for survivors. The involvement of political figures and potential
          manipulation of the legal process further underscore the need for a
          comprehensive examination of the root causes and factors contributing
          to such crimes.

          about the Ram Mandir consecration event.

        <p>
          The suo motu case against the MP was filed by a police sub-inspector
          attached to the Kumta police station. The complaint alleges Hegde was
          recorded on video making provocative statements against other
          religious groups in a speech to BJP workers and supporters on January
          13th.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his address, the far-right MP called for demolishing several
          mosques in Karnataka, similar to Babri Masjid, claiming they were
          constructed over Hindu temples. The BJP had distanced itself from
          Hegde&apos;s comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Some people can take it as a threat also. We will definitely do
          it. This is a decision of the Hindu community, not of Anantkumar
          Hegde,&quot; he stated at the Kumta meeting on Saturday. &quot;...in
          every village of the state there are small religious places which were
          violated. Until they are demolished, the Hindu community will not sit
          idle....,&quot; he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Revenge, revenge, revenge. If we do not take revenge for 1,000
          years, then the Hindu community can clearly say that this is not Hindu
          blood. We are not a community which will be in debt. We will clear the
          debt at any cost,&quot; Hegde emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police complaint registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections
          153, 153A and 505 quotes Hegde&apos;s statements verbatim for making
          inflammatory remarks and fomenting enmity between groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          A five-time BJP MP, Anantkumar Hegde is a prospective BJP Lok Sabha
          candidate from Uttara Kannada for the upcoming elections. He had been
          inactive in public life the past couple of years owing to illness. In
          the past few weeks, Hegde resumed meeting people to secure candidature
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the first time Hegde has stirred controversy with his
          hardline remarks. In 2017, as a Union Minister, he sparked outrage by
          terming secularists as &quot;people without parentage&quot;.
          Previously in 2016, he had equated Islam with terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest case underscores tensions between Hindu nationalist
          politicians and minority groups in Karnataka. It evokes memories of
          the contentious Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 by Hindu nationalist
          mobs who claimed the 16th century mosque was built over a temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          By calling for similar demolitions, Hegde&apos;s rhetoric threatens to
          inflame communal tensions in the state along religious lines. It also
          contradicts the BJP&apos;s official stance of distancing itself from
          his comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Hegde retains significant support among hardcore Hindu
          nationalists and right-wing voters. Despite past controversies, he was
          appointed a central minister and may be renominated for the Lok Sabha
          polls. This highlights the sway of extremist politicians within the
          party.
        </p>
        <p>
          But such figures also damage the BJP&apos;s image among moderate
          voters and minorities. With Karnataka being a communally sensitive
          state, Hegde&apos;s fiery rhetoric has the potential to stir social
          disharmony during election season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police case indicates authorities are taking his remarks seriously
          given their provocative nature. But it remains to be seen whether
          Hegde will face any meaningful censure from within his party or
          criminal charges for his latest outburst.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fate will be an important test of how far the BJP is willing to go
          to contain fringe extremist voices while still harnessing their
          support during elections. It will also determine whether the party
          prizes broader social harmony over consolidating a hardline
          majoritarian voter base.

          As the prolonged winter break ends, schools in Delhi are set to resume
          in-person classes starting today, January 15, 2024. However, as a
          preemptive measure considering the ongoing cold wave conditions and
          foggy weather, school timings have been modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a directive issued by the Education Department on Sunday,
          no schools will commence sessions before 9 AM or continue beyond 5 PM
          until further notice. This adjusted schedule applies to all students
          in government, government-aided, and recognized private schools,
          including those in nursery, kindergarten, and primary sections. The
          order stated that the standard reporting time remains unchanged for
          all teaching and non-teaching faculty.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With the aim of exercising caution given the current foggy
          circumstances, no school (including those with double shifts) will
          begin before 9 AM or have classes after 5 PM until additional
          guidelines are provided,&quot; the order outlined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, on January 7th, Delhi&apos;s Education Minister Atishi
          announced that the winter break would be prolonged until January 12th
          for students from nursery to 5th standard, in light of the severe cold
          wave conditions in the national capital. &quot;Schools in Delhi will
          stay closed for the next 5 days owing to the ongoing cold weather, for
          students from nursery to class 5,&quot; Atishi had tweeted at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Delhi recorded its lowest temperature this winter season so
          far, with the mercury plummeting to 3.5 degrees Celsius. The cold
          intensified further in the Lodhi Road area, where the minimum
          temperature fell to 3.4 degrees Celsius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most parts of Delhi-NCR were enveloped in dense fog, bringing
          visibility on roads down to zero.

          The ongoing tensions in the Red Sea resulting from repeated assaults
          on commercial vessels by Yemen’s Houthi rebels are negatively
          impacting the global supply chain. This could lead to a $10-20
          increase in oil prices for major oil importing countries such as
          India, according to World Economic Forum (WEF) President Borge Brende.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an exclusive interview with India Today TV/Business Today and News
          Director Rahul Kanwal, Brende stated that closing the Suez Canal would
          be detrimental for the global supply chain. He expressed hope that the
          Houthi attacks in the region would cease soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brende made these remarks just as the 54th annual World Economic Forum
          meeting is set to commence in the scenic city of Davos, Switzerland.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the interview, Brende highlighted that trade growth fell to
          0.8% last year compared to 3.4%. However, he remained optimistic that
          global trade will “pick up a bit” this year, despite the Red Sea
          crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;However, it doesn’t take much to also have a negative impact on
          this if we close the Red Sea. Even closing the Suez Canal for weeks
          will have a very negative impact on the global supply chain. So, a lot
          is at stake. We also know that this has an impact on oil prices and
          for major oil-importing countries like India, where a $10-20 increase
          in oil prices will have very negative effects on the economy,&quot; he
          explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;So, I hope that this will not escalate further and that shipping
          can resume as usual in the Red Sea in a few days,&quot; he added.

              Brende was optimistic regarding the Indian economy, projecting 8%
              growth this year. &quot;We think, in the coming decade, we can be
              speaking about a $10 trillion economy, at least in the coming two
              decades,&quot; he stated.
            </p>
            <p>
              He praised India&apos;s growth narrative, noting that the country
              was developing its digital economy twice as fast as the rest of
              the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;India has been at the forefront due to the digital economy
              and the export of services. This is a very sweet spot for India.
              But, of course, reforms should continue in India. Reforms related
              to education, funding and reforms to tackle unnecessary red tape
              should continue. I feel there is an understanding of all these
              things in New Delhi,&quot; Brende remarked.

              Acknowledging India&apos;s increasing global prominence, Brende
              cited an example where there was a &quot;long waiting list&quot;
              of Indian officials waiting to meet him in a room that could only
              accommodate &quot;100 people&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;We have a lot of Indian companies here. India is growing
              very fast. There&apos;s a lot of interest in India. There is a
              country strategy meeting on India where the three ministers that
              are here will conduct, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
              Governor is here too. I was told by my team that it was
              oversubscribed after half an hour. So, there&apos;s a long waiting
              list,&quot; he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;I think we can only fit 100 of them in the room. They are
              still waiting and they can&apos;t get in and they are upset. So, I
              said, maybe we will have to look for a bigger room,&quot; he
              chuckled.

            <p>
              Discussing global economic growth, Brende stated that the WEF
              projected 2.9% growth this year but was hopeful it could surpass
              3% soon. &quot;We should also acknowledge that many economists
              expected a recession in the US, the largest economy constituting
              25% of global GDP. But there is no recession. It&apos;s probably a
              soft landing. We&apos;re seeing inflation abating a bit. Interest
              rates will then go down,&quot; he explained.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;For India, I think if trade grows again and India gets a
              little more tailwind from the global economy in 2025, I think, as
              I said earlier, India could be a $10 trillion economy in the
              medium to long term, provided reforms continue,&quot; he added.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Brende, the upcoming elections in India, the US, the
              UK, Russia and the European Parliament will have a “huge impact”
              on the global economic outlook this &quot;election year&quot;.

              Elaborating on the WEF 2024 theme of rebuilding trust in a
              fractured world, Brende emphasized the need for global
              collaboration due to a “clear trust deficit”.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;There is also huge geopolitical competition. But even in a

          The widely shared footage has provoked numerous reactions from social
          media users calling for action against the passenger. However, some
          pointed to the frustration among travelers given IndiGo&apos;s pileup
          of complaints over cancellations, unreasonable delays, and subpar
          service standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video shows the captain making a statement about delays. Suddenly,
          a passenger wearing a yellow hoodie rushes up and slaps the captain
          across the face. A flight attendant standing next to the captain
          immediately intervenes, shielding the captain and trying to defuse the
          situation. The attacker is then pulled back by another man in a sky
          blue hoodie as commotion spreads in the cabin.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Sir, you cannot do this,&quot; the flight attendant is heard
          saying as she protects the captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many passengers can be heard justifying the passenger&apos;s behavior,
          blaming IndiGo for the delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The captain had announced the delays after replacing the previous crew
          owing to Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations following
          several hours of waiting. The viral video stated the flight was
          &quot;13 hours&quot; delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FDTL rules mandate adequate rest periods for pilots and crew to
          reduce fatigue, established by the Directorate General of Civil
          Aviation (DGCA).
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes amid a barrage of complaints against IndiGo on social
          media, with numerous accounts of delays and chaos. On Saturday, actor
          Radhika Apte shared her terrible experience after being confined on an
          aerobridge at Mumbai airport for hours along with fellow travelers.
          She said IndiGo staff were clueless, depriving passengers including
          seniors and infants of food and restroom breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flight operations have been hampered the past few days due to harsh

          The Indian Army is launching a major counterterrorism operation called
          Operation Sarvashakti in Jammu and Kashmir in response to
          Pakistan&apos;s attempts to increase terrorist activities in the
          region. The goal is to target terrorists operating on both sides of
          the Pir Panjal mountain range which runs through the Union Territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent times, Pakistan has been supporting and directing terrorist
          groups to try to revive terrorism in the areas south of the Pir Panjal
          range, especially in the Rajouri and Poonch districts. Around 20
          Indian troops have been killed there in attacks by Pakistan-backed
          terrorists, with the most recent attack occurring on December 21 in
          the Dera ki Gali area where 4 soldiers were killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operation Sarvashakti will involve combined counterterrorism
          operations on both sides of the Pir Panjal range by formations of the
          Srinagar-based Chinar Corps and the Nagrota-headquartered White Knight
          Corps carrying out simultaneous operations. The Jammu and Kashmir
          Police, Central Reserve Police Force, Special Operations Group, and
          intelligence agencies will work closely together to foil
          Pakistan&apos;s designs to revive terrorism in the region,
          particularly in Rajouri and Poonch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are intended to be similar to Operation Sarpvinash in
          2003 which targeted terrorists in the same area south of the Pir
          Panjals. The Army Chief General Manoj Pande recently stated that
          terrorist activities had almost vanished there since 2003, but
          Pakistan is now trying to revive terrorism in the region again. He and
          the Northern Army Command held detailed discussions on ways to counter
          this new terrorist threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are being closely monitored by Army Headquarters and
          the Northern Command in Udhampur and were planned soon after Home
          Minister Amit Shah held a high-level security meeting with National
          Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the Army, intelligence agencies, and
          police officials. The Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi
          has also held coordination meetings for joint action against
          terrorists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian Army has started inducting more troops into Rajouri and
          Poonch and strengthening intelligence capabilities. The security
          forces are confident of local support to counter terrorism in the
          area. Even when terrorists provoked troops to fire on civilians at
          Krisna Ghati, the forces showed restraint knowing it could turn the
          population against them. Swift action against own officers and men
          involved in civilian deaths post the December 21 encounter has also
          helped maintain local goodwill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are intended to deny any space for terrorism to revive
          in the region. In the last two decades, determined counterterrorism
          efforts have ensured a marked reduction in violence. However, Pakistan
          has continued to support cross-border terrorism to destabilize Jammu
          and Kashmir. Groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed have
          training camps across the border. Terrorists are regularly sent across
          the Line of Control under cover fire from Pakistan Army posts. Local
          youth are radicalized and recruited too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The increase in infiltration attempts over the last year, arms and
          ammunition drops by drones, and recruitments indicate Pakistan&apos;s
          desperation to stoke terrorism especially after the removal of Jammu
          and Kashmir&apos;s special status. Islamabad wants to portray that the
          situation is not normalizing even three years after Article 370 was
          nullified. Also, fomenting trouble in border areas pins down Indian
          forces. With India-Pakistan tensions at a high after recent terrorist
          incidents, Pakistan would want to keep the border hot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its efforts to revive terrorism south of Pir Panjals poses a double
          threat as it provides entry into both Jammu and Kashmir regions.
          Rajouri and Poonch are very close to the strategic Jammu-Srinagar
          National Highway that is the lifeline of the Kashmir valley. Any major
          attack here can have psychological and economic impact far beyond the
          local populace and suits Pakistan&apos;s disruptive agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why the Indian Army is launching coordinated counterterrorism
          operations across the Pir Panjals before terrorism takes root again.
          The aim is to completely eliminate terrorist presence in these areas.
          In 2003 too, relentless operations had broken the back of terrorism
          here. Though eliminating every terrorist is difficult given the
          terrain and porous border, the intent is to inflict unacceptable
          losses through unrelenting pressure. The counter-infiltration grid
          along the Line of Control is also being strengthened to prevent entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the operations to succeed, gaining the confidence of the local
          population is vital. Sympathetic locals provide information, logistics
          and recruits to sustain terrorism. Alienating civilians can undermine
          even the best-planned operations. The Indian Army has reached out to
          the people through meetings, campaigns and civic action programs.
          Steps have been taken to minimize inconvenience and safeguard human
          rights during operations. Conduct of units is being closely monitored
          to avoid collateral damage. Any excesses are promptly investigated and
          punished as seen in the recent action against erring personnel. These
          measures are helping foster goodwill and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operation Sarvashakti has commenced in early 2022 at a time when heavy
          snow limits infiltrations. Come summer, as passes open, more
          terrorists will try to infiltrate. The Indian Army aims to use this
          winter to hit terror groups hard before the summer infiltration
          season. With meticulous preparation, transparency, sensitivity and
          determined execution, these operations can deal a decisive blow. The
          Indian Army remains steadfast in its commitment to break the back of
          Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and usher in an era of peace and
          stability for the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

          President Joe Biden revealed that the United States had privately
          conveyed a message to Iran regarding the Iran-backed Houthi rebels
          carrying out attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea.
          &quot;We delivered it privately and we&apos;re confident we&apos;re
          well-prepared,&quot; Biden told reporters at the White House before
          leaving for Camp David for the weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disclosure comes after the Houthi movement threatened a
          &quot;strong and effective response&quot; following an overnight U.S.
          military strike in Yemen, further increasing tensions as Washington
          vows to protect shipping from assaults by the Iran-aligned group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest U.S. strike, which the Pentagon said targeted Houthi radar
          facilities, occurred a day after dozens of American and British
          strikes on other Houthi sites in Yemen. According to White House
          spokesperson John Kirby, the initial strikes degraded the
          Houthis&apos; capability to store, launch and guide missiles or drones
          which they have frequently used to threaten shipping lanes. Kirby
          emphasized that Washington had no interest in waging war in Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked by journalists whether he now felt the term
          &quot;terrorist&quot; was applicable to the Houthi rebels, Biden
          replied &quot;I think they are.&quot; This comes after the Biden
          administration controversially revoked the State Department&apos;s
          designation of the Houthis as a &quot;foreign terrorist
          organization&quot; in 2021, part of a policy shift aiming to ease
          humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. message to Iran highlights Washington&apos;s belief that
          Tehran bears responsibility for the Houthis&apos; aggressive actions
          as their chief international sponsor and arms supplier. While both
          Iran and the Houthis deny any formal relationship, UN experts have
          found extensive evidence of Iranian weapons transfers and other
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proxy groups like the Houthis give Iran strategic leverage in the
          region while allowing it to maintain deniability for their actions.
          U.S. officials hope conveying their awareness of Iranian ties may
          induce Tehran to reign in the Houthis before the situation escalates
          further.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, experts warn the private U.S. message is unlikely to persuade
          Iran to pull back support and curb Houthi attacks on shipping in the
          Red Sea, a crucial commercial waterway. The Houthis have become
          increasingly brazen, using drones and missiles to target vessels
          sailing to and from the Suez Canal. Millions of barrels of oil pass
          through the area daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Houthis say they are retaliating for coalition airstrikes
          and a sea blockade, their attacks are seen as part of a broader
          Iranian strategy to project power and demonstrate the vulnerability of
          global energy supply chains. Disrupting shipping could also drive up
          oil prices which benefits Tehran.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. is coordinating closely with Gulf allies like Saudi Arabia
          and the UAE who are battling the Houthis in Yemen. But American
          officials are wary of being dragged into Yemen&apos;s complex civil
          war. The limited strikes specifically targeted Houthi capabilities to
          threaten shipping and avoid civilian areas. But analysts caution that
          direct U.S. intervention could empower the Houthis and aid their
          recruitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          With no clear military solution in Yemen, experts argue the only way
          forward is a negotiated settlement between the Houthis and
          Saudi-backed Yemeni government. But meaningful talks have stalled
          despite international efforts. The Houthis may prefer to keep fighting
          amid perceived battlefield gains while the Saudis remain skeptical of
          their intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, the uptick in Houthi attacks has turned the Red Sea
          into an arena for shadowy attacks and counterstrikes. The U.S. message
          to Iran reflects the seriousness with which it views the threat to
          international shipping. While seeking to avoid further escalation,
          Washington also wants to signal its resolve to protect freedom of
          navigation and safeguard a vital global trade artery.

          Amid rising unemployment and a housing crisis in Canada, Immigration
          Minister Marc Miller announced that in the coming months he will
          examine capping the number of international students residing in the
          country. Miller did not specify the extent of the reduction being
          considered in the immigration system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview with Vassy Kapelos on CTV&apos;s Question Period,
          Miller stated a federal-provincial discussion is needed &quot;to
          ensure provinces not doing their jobs actually rein in student numbers
          purely on a volume basis.&quot; He said the volume of international
          students in Canada is &quot;disconcerting&quot; and the system has
          &quot;gotten out of control.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller plans to explore setting a cap on international students in the
          first half of 2023 to help ease housing demand. When asked why the
          government is only now considering a cap despite the idea being raised
          months ago, he said federal level data is needed first before
          examining each province&apos;s institutions that may be profiting from
          high enrollment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It&apos;s time to have a conversation about volumes and the
          impact that is having in certain areas,&quot; Miller added. A student
          cap would not be a one-size-fits-all solution for housing shortages
          nationwide, he noted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller also said housing is only one factor in immigration targets.
          The pressing need to lower the workforce&apos;s average age must also
          be considered. While not providing specifics, he said reducing student
          numbers through a cap is under consideration and will remain so. Out
          of courtesy to the provinces, these discussions will occur at the
          negotiating table first, Miller stated, also factoring in
          institutions&apos; financial needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government has faced criticism for accepting rising immigrants,
          both permanent and temporary, amid a housing crisis. Internal
          documents show public servants warned two years ago that high
          immigration goals could threaten affordability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Liberals aim to welcome 485,000 immigrants this year, and 500,000
          in 2025 and 2026. Hundreds of thousands of temporary residents like
          international students and migrant workers also arrive annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          A student cap would aim to curb demand, but risks detrimental impacts
          on institutions reliant on their tuition. Canada is a top global study
          destination and international students provide economic benefits. A
          balanced approach is needed to manage volumes without disrupting
          education and migration systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provinces like Ontario which attract nearly 40% of Canada&apos;s
          international students could be disproportionately affected by a
          blanket cap. A tailored province-wise approach may be more prudent.
          Students also create jobs and growth, so local labor market needs must
          be analyzed before reducing numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capping student visas also does not address the root cause of housing
          unaffordability - insufficient supply. A cap could even worsen
          shortages if students continue arriving while fewer homes get built.
          Alongside any immigration changes, experts stress boosting housing
          supply by updating zoning laws and slashing red tape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stakeholder views are important too before enacting a cap.
          Institutions warn blunt cuts could cripple revenue and impact
          learning. Students fear upending their future plans. A nuanced
          solution like needs-based entry could be explored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatives like rent controls, vacant home taxes and boosting
          on-campus housing should be considered as well. A student cap risks
          damaging Canada’s reputation as a welcoming study destination.
          Partnerships with universities to align enrollment and housing
          capacity better could be fruitful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, a balanced approach is required that stabilizes
          immigration at sustainable levels while rapidly expanding housing
          supply, especially affordable units. Canada’s future growth and
          competitiveness hinges on getting this policy mix right. A student cap
          may be one temporary tool, but broader structural solutions around
          housing and immigration are imperative for lasting impact.

          Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy recently revealed in a CNBC-TV18
          interview that he had once applied for a job at Wipro but was
          rejected, leading to the genesis of Infosys, one of Wipro&apos;s
          fiercest competitors in the IT industry. Wipro&apos;s former chairman
          Azim Premji later admitted to Murthy that not hiring him was a
          mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Azim once told me that one of the biggest mistakes he made was
          not hiring me,&quot; the 77-year-old Murthy said. He added that if
          Premji had hired him, things may have transpired differently for both
          him and Wipro.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1981, Murthy founded Infosys along with six friends and 10,000
          rupees of seed capital provided by his wife and author Sudha Murty.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Murthy built Infosys from the ground up, Premji transformed his
          family&apos;s vegetable oil business into a global IT solutions
          provider. As of January 2024, Infosys is valued at 6.65 lakh crore
          rupees while Wipro stands at 2.43 lakh crore, exemplifying the
          divergent fortunes of the two IT titans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy&apos;s entrepreneurial journey began with a research job at IIM
          Ahmedabad followed by a stint as chief systems programmer developing
          India&apos;s first BASIC interpreter for an early computer. After a
          failed prior tech venture called Softronics, the seeds of Infosys were
          sown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy&apos;s perspective on family businesses differs markedly from
          Premji&apos;s approach. While Premji&apos;s son Rishad took over the
          reins at Wipro in 2019, Murthy asserts his son Rohan would never ask
          to be part of Infosys. &quot;I think he&apos;s even stricter than me
          on these ideas; he will never say that,&quot; Murthy stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decades ago, Murthy similarly rejected his wife Sudha Murty&apos;s
          wish to join Infosys, a decision he now regrets. Murthy admitted he
          was wrongly idealistic in not supporting Sudha, an engineer he says
          was more qualified than Infosys&apos; founders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy has espoused keeping family and business separate, wanting
          Infosys to be a meritocratic workplace not influenced by nepotism. He
          credits Infosys&apos; success to its world-class governance and
          management entirely unrelated to the founders&apos; families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infosys&apos; credo of empowering professionals on merit dissuaded
          Murthy&apos;s children from seeing Infosys as their entitlement.
          Murthy takes pride that his daughter is a schoolteacher and son is an
          academic uninterested in Infosys. He believes family businesses often
          struggle when incompetent heirs ascend due to privilege rather than
          capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Premji&apos;s grooming of Rishad since 2007 to lead Wipro evokes the
          old-world family business model where bloodline trumps merit.
          Murthy&apos;s point is underscored by the middling performance of many
          Indian family conglomerates. Infosys&apos; rise as a global success
          story built on transparent governance and talent shows an alternative
          path.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Premji&apos;s well-planned generational transition has so far
          been smooth. Rishad&apos;s track record includes leading Wipro&apos;s
          strategy and M&A for years before assuming the CEO role. Good
          succession planning has allowed the $11 billion company to continue
          its growth trajectory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts say neither approach is necessarily right or wrong. Premji has
          ensured continuity and stability by elevating his son. Murthy has
          upheld fairness and achievement by excluding his children. There are
          merits and demerits to both philosophies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, what matters is identifying and empowering the right
          leaders to take an organization forward. Wipro and Infosys exemplify
          how different leadership models can thrive. Their unique approaches
          shaped by the personal values of their pioneering founders offer
          important lessons for Indian business.

        <p>
          Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, is poised for an elevation
          within the royal family to a pivotal role in King Charles III’s
          restructured monarchy. According to reports, the mother of three could
          be granted new powers by the King after celebrating her 42nd birthday
          recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mail reported that Kate will mark her birthday privately in
          Windsor with husband Prince William and their children George,
          Charlotte and Louis, before returning to school. But soon, she is
          expected to be promoted as per a source.
        </p>
        <p>
          King Charles is said to be considering appointing Kate as a Royal Lady
          of the Order of the Garter. This is regarded as Britain&apos;s most
          senior chivalric order, with members personally chosen by the monarch.
          Prince William, Camilla, Princess Anne and Prince Edward already
          belong to the Order of the Garter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If inducted, Kate would gain the authority to grant royal warrants,
          similar to Camilla and William. Granting royal warrants allows firms
          to use the Royal Arms in branding and supply the royal household. This
          power was previously held by King Charles as Prince of Wales,
          bequeathed by the late Queen Elizabeth II.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Charles retains the power for now, he may eventually grant it to
          Camilla and William too. But some royal warrant holders believe Kate
          officially endorsing brands would provide a huge boost to British
          industry, driving fashion and lifestyle interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a working member of the royal family, Kate has grown into her roles
          over the years. She has focused on early childhood development,
          promoting sports and outdoor activities. Along with William, Kate has
          also advocated for mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, she played piano publically for the first time during a
          Christmas carol concert. Kate has also emphasized environmental
          awareness and sustainability through her initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per reports, King Charles aims to reduce costs and streamline the
          monarchy to core members carrying out official duties. These include
          Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, Princess Anne and Prince Edward
          and his wife Sophie.
        </p>
        <p>
          The promotion indicates Kate’s ever-important position in the new
          royal order. It reflects the faith Charles has in the Princess to take
          on more responsibility as a senior royal.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 41, Kate is the youngest Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter
          after Queen Mary in the early 1900s. Her induction will make her the
          only woman apart from Camilla in the order. It highlights her
          significance and the prominence of her role alongside William.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles is expected to undertake the Order of the Garter appointments
          in June 2023. The ceremony takes place annually at St. George’s Chapel
          in Windsor. The order consists of the monarch, prince consort, and 24
          knights chosen personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in 1348 by King Edward III, it recognizes high achievement and
          public service. The knights wear elaborate blue velvet robes and
          plumed hats for ceremonies. New knights take part in an investiture
          and pageantry-filled service presided by the King.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Kate, being granted powers to endorse royal warrants shortly after
          turning 40 reinforces her image as a dependable future queen consort.
          It reflects the royal family&apos;s confidence in her maturity and
          readiness for more responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          From being a commoner to future Queen, Kate has come a long way. Her
          evolution into a senior working royal will only accelerate after this
          promotion. With King Charles intent on a meritocratic monarchy, Kate
          and Prince William will have to continually prove their mettle as the
          new face of the modern royal family.

          Tensions have escalated along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border after
          Pakistan began demanding passports and visas from Afghan truck drivers
          at the key Torkham crossing on Saturday. For years, truckers have been
          able to cross freely without documents. But the new requirements have
          effectively closed the vital trade route.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noor Mohammad Hanif, an official in Afghanistan&apos;s Nangarhar
          province, said Pakistani officials suddenly started asking Afghan
          drivers for passports and visas at Torkham. Since most drivers do not
          possess these documents, traffic has stalled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In retaliation, Afghanistan has also started demanding the same from
          Pakistani truckers, according to a statement from the Nangarhar
          governor&apos;s office. Officials from both sides are holding
          discussions to resolve the impasse, with a decision expected soon, the
          statement added.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Torkham crossing has experienced closures multiple times in recent
          months, including a nine-day shutdown in September due to border
          forces clashing. On Saturday, dozens of trucks carrying perishable
          items like vegetables and fruits remained stuck on both sides, unable
          to cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysts see this as part of the lingering tensions between Pakistan
          and Afghanistan&apos;s Taliban government. Pakistan is worried about
          the Pakistani Taliban finding sanctuary and regrouping in Afghanistan
          after the Taliban takeover. It has blamed the group for increased
          militant attacks against Pakistani security forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Afghan Taliban denies allowing Pakistani Taliban fighters
          to use its soil for attacks in Pakistan. Last week, senior Pakistani
          politician Fazlur Rehman visited Kabul, the first high-level visit
          since the Taliban takeover, to ease frictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mistrust persists, as evident from the Torkham situation. Pakistan
          remains concerned about militant activity across the porous border.
          Demanding documents from previously exempt truckers appears to be an
          attempt to tighten control and track movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The border crisis comes amid Pakistan&apos;s ongoing expulsion of
          hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghans, further straining ties.
          Since August 2022, over half a million Afghans without valid papers
          have been deported. Pakistan has long hosted nearly 1.7 million
          Afghans who fled the Soviet occupation and subsequent conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this latest standoff, trade and commerce between the two
          countries will be severely impacted. Torkham is a vital commercial
          artery and trade route to Central Asia for Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          For landlocked Afghanistan, access to the Arabian seaports through
          Pakistan is crucial for exports and imports. Disruptions at Torkham
          will choke key supplies of food, medicines and essential commodities.
          It may exacerbate Afghanistan&apos;s humanitarian crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the border remains closed to traffic, prices of goods transported
          by road may rise sharply in both nations. Transporters will also
          suffer major losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid greater public hardship, both sides will have to resolve the
          documentation dispute quickly through diplomatic channels. Wider
          engagement is also needed to address the core issues driving
          Pakistan&apos;s security concerns and perceived threat from
          Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restarting stalled talks between Taliban and Pakistani authorities on
          border management may help instil confidence. But for now, the
          unpredictable border situation highlights the delicate ties between
          the uneasy neighbours.

          The extreme overcrowding in Maharashtra&apos;s state prisons has led
          to a rise in skin diseases among inmates. To address this issue, the
          Maharashtra prison department has introduced washing machines in jails
          for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Yerwada Central Prison in Pune has become the first jail in the
          state to provide washing machines for inmates. So far, all jails have
          placed orders for 193 washing machines in total.
        </p>
        <p>
          On an experimental basis, nine washing machines were installed in
          Yerwada Central Prison last Friday. Prison officials said they would
          study the impact of using washing machines and based on the results,
          considering the needs, install up to 325 washing machines in all jails
          in the near future.

              Yerwada Prison has an official capacity of 2,753 inmates (2,536
              males, 226 females). But currently, there are 6,610 inmates -
              6,324 males and 286 females. Of these, 5,572 inmates are under
              judicial custody, 972 are convicts, and 66 are detained under the
              Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prison authorities said jails across the state face similar
              overcrowding. While overcrowding contributes to the rise in skin
              diseases, disinfecting inmates&apos; clothes and bedding through
              proper washing is essential for prevention, officials said.
            </p>
            <p>
              The introduction of washing machines follows the example of New
              Delhi&apos;s Tihar Jail. Maharashtra&apos;s prison department is
              taking a cue from there, said Amitabh Gupta, Additional Director
              General of Police (Prisons).
            </p>
            <p>
              While the exact number of inmates with skin diseases was
              unavailable, Gupta said it was very high, with long queues at the
              doctor for skin treatment.

              In addition to washing machines, Yerwada Prison inaugurated
              biometric touch screen e-kiosks on Friday. Using the e-kiosks,
              inmates can quickly access information on their case status,
              account balance, hearing dates, and more. Inmates can also have
              online meetings with lawyers and family through the e-mulakat

              Officials said overcrowding increases chances of unrest in jails.
              Last month, a murder occurred inside Yerwada jail. There are about
              1,200 inmates in Yerwada booked under the Maharashtra Control of

              segregate members of rival gangs and those accused of terrorism,
              naxalism, etc. More CCTV cameras are being installed in 14
              prisons. A panic button system is also proposed to alert officials

          Pushyamitra Bhargava left his successful legal career to become the
          mayor of Indore in 2022, promising to bring corporate culture to the
          municipal corporation. Recently, he has drawn attention for directing
          all malls and shops in Indore to install replicas of the Ram Temple in
          Ayodhya. He warned of consequences for those who fail to comply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two weeks ago, Bhargava wrote to all shopkeepers and malls,
          instructing them to install the replicas between January 15-22,
          coinciding with the temple&apos;s consecration anniversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, he justified the order, stating that if Christmas decor is
          allowed from December 25 to January 2, then Ram Temple replicas should
          also be permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before entering politics, Bhargava was the youngest additional
          advocate general of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. Born and raised in
          Indore, he has an M.Phil in Law from Devi Ahilya University, a cyber
          law diploma from Mumbai, and a journalism certificate from Allahabad
          University. During college, he was active in the ABVP, the BJP&apos;s
          student wing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhargava began his legal career under senior advocate Piyush Mathur, a
          former MP High Court judge. He rose to become the state&apos;s
          youngest deputy advocate general from 2015-2018. He represented the
          government in high-profile cases, including on medical oxygen supply
          during Covid, direct student union elections, and a web series
          allegedly insulting the army.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, Bhargava organized events supporting the Citizenship
          Amendment Act. He also led a &quot;Lawyers for Modi&quot; campaign for
          the 2019 elections. Additionally, he formed a youth organization
          called Sanghmitra to connect youth with patriotism and national
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 2022 mayoral polls, Bhargava defeated his Congress opponent by
          a huge margin, becoming BJP&apos;s youngest Indore mayor. His Ram
          temple replica order has now sparked controversy.

        </p>
        <p>
          However, Kejriwal is likely to be in Goa from January 18-20 to oversee
          his Aam Aadmi Party&apos;s election preparations there, posing a
          scheduling conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Delhi CM has skipped ED questioning on three previous occasions,
          citing reasons like impending Rajya Sabha elections, Republic Day
          engagements as Chief Minister, and lack of response from the ED to his
          queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his latest communication to the ED Assistant Director, Kejriwal
          highlighted that the Election Commission has scheduled Rajya Sabha
          polls from Delhi on January 19. As national convener of AAP, which has
          fielded candidates, he is preoccupied with the nominations and
          campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, as Delhi CM, Kejriwal wrote he is busy with Republic Day
          event planning and preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the third instance of Kejriwal questioning the rationale
          behind ED&apos;s summons via written response instead of physically
          appearing. He expressed concern that despite comprehensively
          responding and raising legal objections, the ED chose not to provide
          clarification.
        </p>
        <p>
          In previous letters, Kejriwal termed the summons as politically
          motivated and alleged they were issued to harass him. He asked the ED
          to specify if he is being summoned as a witness or suspect and in what
          capacity. But the ED did not respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agency wants to question Kejriwal in connection with alleged
          irregularities in Delhi&apos;s now-scrapped excise policy. It claims
          kickbacks and corruption took place when the policy was formulated and
          implemented during Kejriwal&apos;s tenure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ED and CBI filed FIRs in the matter after Delhi LG Vinai Kumar
          Saxena recommended a probe. He alleged violations of rules and
          procedural lapses in the policy, which purportedly benefited private
          liquor dealers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides Deputy CM Manish Sisodia who handled the excise portfolio, the
          ED has questioned and arrested other AAP leaders and excise department
          officials. Sisodia has been questioned for over 30 hours so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          AAP has denied any wrongdoing and accused the BJP-led central
          government of a political witchhunt. Kejriwal earlier alleged he is
          being deliberately targeted to stop AAP&apos;s growing national
          footprint ahead of elections in various states.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ED summons have disrupted governance work, claimed AAP. However,
          the BJP retorted that if Kejriwal has done no wrong, he should not
          fear investigation agencies and cooperate.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Kejriwal unlikely to appear on January 18 given his engagements,
          it remains to be seen if the ED will relent or take a strong stand.
          The agency can ask a court to direct Kejriwal to join the probe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some analysts argue ED&apos;s repeated summons are creating an
          impression that it is overzealous about questioning Kejriwal. They
          suggest the agency should discuss the concerns raised in his letters
          before issuing fresh summons.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AAP aims to make inroads in Gujarat and other states, the timing of
          the probe is being seen as intended to dent its prospects. The tussle
          between the Centre and Delhi government looks set to continue, with
          both sides standing firm on their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kejriwal&apos;s non-appearance may provide more ammunition to BJP to
          allege he has something to hide. However, AAP is also likely to use it
          to claim victimization at the hands of the Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the impasse will end remains uncertain. But the excise case has
          certainly introduced new political drama and tensions between
          Delhi&apos;s ruling party and the central government.

          Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India&apos;s longest sea
          bridge, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri Nhava Sheva Atal Setu, also
          known as the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), on Friday. The bridge
          is named after former Prime Minister and BJP veteran Atal Bihari
          Vajpayee.
        </p>
        <p>
          This bridge is set to revolutionize travel for Mumbaikars by reducing
          the two-hour journey from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai to just 20 minutes.
          Under construction for the past six years at a massive cost of around
          Rs 20,000 crores, the Atal Setu has been hailed as a boon for
          commuters.
        </p>
        <p>
          By spanning 22 km over the sea, the bridge drastically cuts down the
          travel distance between Sewri in South Mumbai and Chirle near Nhava
          Sheva in Navi Mumbai from 42 km to 22 km. This not only saves precious
          time but also promotes fuel conservation, addressing a pressing
          concern in busy Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touted as India&apos;s longest sea bridge, the project includes a 16.5
          km long section over the sea and a 5.5 km elevated stretch over land.
          As per officials, it has a design capacity of 70,000 vehicles daily,
          enabling smooth travel at 100 km/hr on average.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting at Sewri and ending at Chirle near Nhava Sheva, the Atal Setu
          offers key interchanges at Sewri, Shivajinagar, State Highway 54, and
          NH-348. This strategic connectivity significantly enhances local links
          while also establishing vital access to Pune, Goa and southern India,
          promoting regional integration.

          After nearly 8 years, the wreckage of an Indian Air Force An-32
          aircraft that went missing in 2016 has finally been discovered on the
          seabed of the Bay of Bengal. The plane, with registration number
          K-2743, had disappeared during a flight from Port Blair to Chennai on
          July 22, 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday, the Indian Air Force announced that debris from the crashed
          aircraft has been located at a depth of approximately 3.4 km, around
          310 km off the Chennai coast. The discovery was made by India&apos;s
          National Institute of Ocean Technology using specialized deep sea
          search equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the IAF statement, NIOT recently deployed an advanced
          Autonomous Underwater Vehicle equipped with deep sea exploration
          capabilities to survey the aircraft&apos;s last known position.
          Multiple sensor payloads were utilized, including multi-beam sonar,
          synthetic aperture sonar and high-resolution photography. Analysis of
          the search imagery revealed the presence of aircraft debris on the
          seabed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were 29 people on board the ill-fated An-32 transport plane that
          fateful day in 2016. After the plane went missing mid-flight, an
          extensive search and rescue operation was launched over the Bay of
          Bengal but no signs of the aircraft or passengers were found.
          Eventually all 29 were presumed dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent discovery of the wreckage thus provides some closure after
          years of the aircraft&apos;s mysterious disappearance. Efforts will
          now focus on attempting to retrieve the flight data recorder as well
          as any remains to aid the investigation into this tragic incident. The
          families of the lost passengers and crew will also get some answers to
          the enduring questions surrounding the crash.

          The U.S. and British militaries bombed over a dozen sites used by
          Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on Thursday. The massive
          retaliatory strike utilized warship and submarine missiles alongside
          fighter jets to target air defenses, drone and missile storage, and
          launching locations, officials said.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden stated the strikes demonstrated the U.S. and allies
          &quot;will not tolerate&quot; the militant group&apos;s relentless
          attacks on the Red Sea. Biden said they only acted after attempts at
          diplomacy and careful consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strikes directly responded to unprecedented Houthi attacks on
          international ships, including first-time use of anti-ship ballistic
          missiles, endangering personnel and trade, Biden explained. He added
          he will take further measures as needed to protect people and
          commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Yemen&apos;s capital Sanaa, journalists heard four explosions early
          Friday local time. Residents in the port city of Hodeida said they
          heard five strong blasts. Witnesses also reported strikes in cities
          south of Sanaa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinated assault marked the first U.S. military response to the
          Houthis&apos; persistent attacks on commercial vessels since the
          Israel-Hamas war began. It came just a week after the U.S. and
          partners warned the Houthis to stop or risk potential military action.
          The warning briefly deterred attacks before the rebels&apos;
          largest-ever drone and missile barrage on shipping Tuesday, prompting
          U.S. and British ships to shoot down missiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials said after Tuesday&apos;s attacks, Biden met with advisors
          and directed the retaliatory strikes. The UK confirmed its Royal Air
          Force took part, with fighters from Cyprus. Allied nations joined the
          U.S. and UK in saying they won&apos;t hesitate to defend lives and
          commerce, though the aim is de-escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis vowed retaliation, warning any attack will spark a fierce
          response beyond imagination. Houthi-run media described strikes
          hitting bases, airports and camps. Casualties remain unclear.
          Officials don&apos;t expect the strikes will eliminate Houthi
          capabilities but may prompt retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis say their attacks aim to stop Israel&apos;s war in Gaza.
          But their targets increasingly have little connection to Israel while
          imperiling a crucial Asia-Europe trade route. The UN Security Council
          passed a resolution Wednesday demanding the Houthis immediately halt
          attacks and implicitly condemned their Iranian weapons suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The broad coalition battling the Houthis shows the Biden
          administration&apos;s effort to avoid appearing unilateral. Multiple
          ships have already been struck despite a U.S.-led maritime mission to
          protect shipping. The U.S. long declined to signal when patience would
          run out before Wednesday&apos;s warning of consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reluctance reflected sensitivities about the shaky Yemen truce and
          worries about triggering wider regional conflict. But the
          attacks&apos; impact on shipping and escalation triggered the
          coalition warning. The strikes underscored using a united front rather
          than opening a new war front alone.

          A tragic incident occurred at the prestigious Indian Institute of
          Technology Kanpur (IIT-K) where an MTech student was found dead in his
          hostel room on Wednesday evening. According to police, the 26-year-old
          student, Vikas Kumar Meena, appeared to have died by suicide though
          further investigations are underway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vikas was enrolled in the Aerospace Engineering department at IIT-K
          and originally hailed from Meerut. After visiting the campus and
          speaking to faculty and students, Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner
          Akhil Kumar shared some preliminary findings though noted the probe is
          still ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stated that on Wednesday evening, Vikas&apos;s death in his hostel
          room was reported and at first glance, it seems to be a potential
          suicide case. However, only after a full post-mortem examination and
          further investigations can police definitively determine causes and
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police have obtained a digital copy of a purported suicide note which
          cites some academic issues that Vikas was facing. The note apparently
          claims no one else should be blamed for his actions. However,
          authorities are still working to verify the authenticity of the note
          and confirm it was written by Vikas before his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to investigating officials, some of Vikas&apos;s peers had
          gone to his locked hostel room after not getting any response to their
          knocks. When he still did not respond, institute officials were
          informed and the room&apos;s lock was broken, only to discover
          Vikas&apos;s body hanging inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking to media, Vikas&apos;s father Anil Kumar Meena revealed his
          son had grown depressed after recently receiving an academic
          termination notice from IIT-K which he could not timely appeal
          against. Anil claims Vikas felt he could have gotten the notice
          repealed if granted the appeal opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police are still holding on to Vikas&apos;s mobile phone and the
          alleged suicide note. Anil described his son as a very friendly person
          and believes the termination notice directly led to his suicide due to
          resulting depression.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, IIT-K officials clarified that such termination warning
          letters are meant to prompt students to meet with faculty and address
          their issues, and can be easily challenged to get revoked. But Vikas
          apparently did not take these steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its statement, IIT-K called Vikas an academically bright student
          who joined the MTech program in 2021. Losing him is a major loss for
          the institute and his passing is deeply upsetting, the statement
          added. Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner also mentioned having
          discussions with IIT-K&apos;s Director to ascertain the full
          circumstances and consider corrective actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The investigation into Vikas&apos;s tragic death remains ongoing as
          police work to conclusively determine the causes and events leading up
          to the suspected suicide. His family, friends and the IIT-K community
          are grieving the devastating loss of a promising young student and
          individual.

          An Ohio woman who was criminally charged for allegedly mishandling a
          home miscarriage will not be indicted, a grand jury decided on
          Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor&apos;s office in Trumbull County said the grand jury
          declined to charge Brittany Watts, 34, of Warren with abuse of a
          corpse. This resolved a controversial case that drew national
          attention for its implications for pregnant women as states enact new
          laws on reproductive healthcare access post - Roe v. Wade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision came just before around 150 supporters gathered for a
          rally supporting Watts in Warren&apos;s Courthouse Square. Watts
          addressed the crowd, thanking her community and declaring she will
          continue fighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watts&apos; attorney said an outpouring of public support helped her
          client endure being charged with a felony. The lawyer stated that
          despite how upsetting it sounds, Watts&apos; experience reflects the
          sad reality of miscarriage. They expressed relief and gratitude that
          the grand jury reached a just decision today.
        </p>
        <p>
          A municipal judge previously found probable cause against Watts.
          Prosecutors alleged she miscarried into a toilet, removed contents to
          outdoor trash, and left the 22-week fetus lodged in pipes. Records
          show her doctor advised hospital induction due to nonviable pregnancy
          and serious risks. But complications and delays prevented treatment.
          After miscarrying at home, she unsuccessfully tried going to a hair
          appointment before friends insisted she go to the hospital. A
          nurse&apos;s 911 call spurred the ensuing investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor argued the issue was not how or when the fetus died,
          but that Watts discarded it in the toilet, clogging it, and went about
          her day. An autopsy found the fetus died in utero with no recent
          injuries. Watts&apos; lawyer contended she had no criminal record and
          was being vilified for a common occurrence. The lawyer also questioned
          whether the abuse-of-corpse statute clearly defined terms like
          &quot;corpse&quot; and &quot;outrage&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          After binding the case over, the judge acknowledged better scholars
          should determine the fetus&apos;s precise legal status. Now, the
          prosecutor says further investigation found Watts committed no crime,
          despite disagreeing with the lower court&apos;s law application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advocates expressed relief at the outcome, but warned Watts&apos; case
          exemplifies the threats Black women face for pregnancy outcomes amid
          abortion restrictions. They called for ending the criminalization of
          reproductive outcomes, which undermines rights and deters necessary
          care. Watts hopes her experience prompts change through education and
          legislation so no other woman endures similar trauma fighting for
          freedom.

          In a tragic example of a failed romantic relationship, a man in Mumbai
          killed his partner. Three months ago, the pair connected on social
          media. The incident happened in Navi Mumbai&apos;s Turbhe. The crime
          blurred the lines between revenge and love when a 24-year-old man
          named Shoaib Sheikh planned the 35-year-old bank manager Amit Kaur—a
          divorcee and mother of a teenage girl was killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story started a few months ago, when Shoaib and Amit connected on
          social media. When Shoaib arrived in Turbhe on January 8th to
          celebrate Kaur&apos;s birthday, what appeared to be a blossoming
          romance took a dark turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the details given by the police, it appears that Shoaib
          killed Amit Kaur by strangulation in a lodge where they were
          celebrating, driven by feelings of suspicion and grief. Shoaib left
          the scene after carrying out the horrific deed, leaving the staff to
          discover the woman&apos;s lifeless body when they opened the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shoaib Sheikh was taken into custody by the Sakinaka police in Mumbai
          after they carried out an investigation. After being arrested, the
          young man—who worked in a garage—finally admitted to the crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the police, Shoaib&apos;s misgivings about his lover
          ultimately motivated him to commit the murder. The victim, a
          well-liked bank manager, had no idea what evil plans had been
          simmering inside of Shoaib.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic event clarified the effects of a relationship poisoned by
          suspicion and deceit. The community was left reeling from the shocking
          reality that had descended upon them as the legal proceedings
          progressed and the dark secrets underlying this bizarre story of love
          and betrayal continued to come to light.

          The word &quot;Veg&quot; is clearly visible on the wrapper of her food
          packet in the pictures she posted, but the chicken pieces inside are
          also irresistible. The woman continued to tweet &quot;When I told the
          cabin supervisor (Sona), she apologized and told me that there were
          other complaints about the same issue besides mine and my

          Veera also appeared to be having trouble with the flight&apos;s

          Air India has not yet responded to this incident, so Jain urged the

          the situation.

          Ankita Bhandari, 19, was murdered in September 2022 while working as a
          receptionist in an upscale resort in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand. Since
          then, the murder has taken a new turn, with her mother calling for the
          arrest of a prominent member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party
          (BJP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother, Soni Devi, reportedly made the claim in a video,
          claiming that BJP MLA Renu Bisht had given the order to destroy
          evidence linked to the murder case by burning the victim&apos;s room
          at the Vanantra Resort, where her daughter worked as a receptionist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that BJP leader Vinod Arya&apos;s son Pulkit and two others
          were arrested following a furious public outcry following the
          disappearance of Ankita, whose body was subsequently discovered in
          Rishikesh&apos;s Chilla barrage. The luxurious resort&apos;s owner,
          Pulkit, is said to have thrown her into the water when she resisted
          being made to serve a VIP guest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl&apos;s mother also claimed that the state BJP secretary, Ajay
          Kumar, had appeared in witness statements nearly a year and a half
          after the crime, and she urged Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar
          Singh Dhami to act right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the intense public outcry surrounding the Ankita Bhandari
          murder case in 2022, the Uttarakhand Police assigned the case to a
          special investigation team (SIT) headed by senior IPS officer P Renuka
          Devi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Declaring that the Dhami government had betrayed her, Soni Devi
          expressed &quot;Arrest Ajay Kumar as it&apos;s evident that his name
          surfaced in the probe as the VIP who visited the resort,&quot; Soni
          Devi stated in the Sunday video statement. It added &quot;Arrest MLA
          Renu Bisht as well as Pramod Kumar, the former SDM, who gave the order
          for a JCB driver to destroy Ankita&apos;s room.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspector General of Police Nilesh Anand Bharne told news agency ANI
          that &quot;no evidence or statement about any VIP was presented during
          the investigation and testimony in court.&quot; He also stated that
          &quot;many serious allegations have been made by Ankita
          Bhandari&apos;s parents in the media and the social media about the
          so-called VIPs.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The accusations made by Ankita&apos;s mother have also been refuted by
          the BJP. &quot;In a fit of rage, Ankita&apos;s parents have made
          accusations, and the Congress party is expressing its frustration over
          electoral setbacks. The BJP leader&apos;s character is being attacked
          by the opposition using Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s remarks as
          cover. The government and the BJP are with the victim&apos;s family
          and justice will be done in the case as it is sub judice.&quot;, news
          reports as such cited a party leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a PTI report, Uttarakhand Congress president Karan Mahara
          shared Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s video statement and asked,
          &quot;When will Dhami answer our daughter Ankita Bhandari&apos;s
          mother&apos;s tears?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother further claimed in her statement that his wife
          had been sent to Pithoragarh and that the Dhami government had falsely
          filed a case against social worker Ashutosh Negi, who was assisting
          her in the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I will sacrifice my life if the case against Negi is not dropped
          soon and his wife&apos;s transfer is not cancelled,&quot; the woman
          declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahara stated that similar accusations had also been made by
          Ankita&apos;s father in a letter addressed to the Pauri District
          Magistrate, and that the entire incident ought to be looked into under
          the supervision of a sitting High Court judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It is imperative that action be taken against these allegations
          if there is even the slightest degree of truth,&quot; he declared.

          Regarding disqualification petitions submitted by organizations led by
          former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Shinde, Rahul Narwekar
          rendered a decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Wednesday, the Speaker declared that the Thackeray-led faction had
          not submitted any documentation indicating that a meeting of the Shiv
          Sena&apos;s national executive had taken place to determine which
          faction of the party was the legitimate one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court gave Narwekar another deadline extension on December
          15, ordering him to make a decision on the petitions by January 10.
          The Maharashtra Speaker was initially instructed by a five-judge bench
          led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud to hear and rule on the
          disqualification petitions within a “reasonable time” in May of last
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena broke up in June 2022 when Chief Minister Eknath Shinde
          rebelled against Thackeray&apos;s Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition,
          claiming the backing of 39 of the party&apos;s 55 MLAs in addition to
          10 independent MLAs. In the government, allies included the Congress,
          the Nationalist Congress Party, and the Shiv Sena.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Thackeray faction has demanded the disqualification of Shinde and
          other MLAs. There were 34 such petitions pending before the Speaker in
          total.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Thackeray, had petitioned the Supreme
          Court on the eve of Narwekar&apos;s verdict, citing concerns about a
          recent meeting between Shinde and Narwekar, according to NDTV. This
          was compared by the former chief minister to a &quot;judge meeting a
          criminal.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray charged the Maharashtra
          government of trying to silence the opinions of those outside the
          ruling class ahead of the Speaker&apos;s decision on Wednesday,
          according to ANI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leader of the Nationalist Congress Party and acting deputy speaker
          Narhari Zirwal initiated the disqualification process in June 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court ruled in May that former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat
          Singh Koshyari had erred in concluding that the Shinde-led rebellion
          had caused the Thackeray government to lose its majority. However, the
          court further ruled that the Maha Vikas Aghadi could not be reinstated
          after Thackeray resigned without being put to a floor test.

          against law enforcement and civilians.

              Gangs that are connected to powerful cartels in Mexico and
              Colombia, most notably Los Choneros, have committed acts of
              violence, including attacking television studios, setting off
              explosions in numerous cities, and kidnapping police officers.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the largest gang in Ecuador, Los Choneros, led by Jose
              Adolfo Macias, also known as &quot;Fito,&quot; escaped, President
              Noboa declared a state of emergency and instituted a curfew for
              the evening hours on Monday.
            </li>
            <li>
              Later, groups affiliated with cartels from Mexico and Colombia,
              including Ecuadorian gangs, detonated bombs in multiple cities and
              kidnapped multiple police officers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Armed with guns, these gang members broke into a TC television
              studio in the port city of Guayaquil on Tuesday. &quot;Don&apos;t
              shoot, please don&apos;t shoot,&quot; pleaded a woman&apos;s voice
              over gunfire during a live TC broadcast.
            </li>
            <li>
              After police broke into the studio, thirteen people were taken
              into custody.

          <ul className="space-y-1.5 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Ecuador is a prime target for drug trafficking organizations due
              to its strategic location on the cocaine trade route that connects
              Peru and Colombia.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Ecuador, drug-related violence has been on the rise for a long
              time; between 2018 and 2022, the murder rate quadrupled, peaking
              at over 7,800 killings last year.
            </li>
            <li>
              In an effort to increase their power and influence, rival gangs
              connected to the cartels in Mexico and Colombia fight for control
              of drug routes and territory in Ecuador.
            </li>
            <li>
              The country&apos;s faltering economy, in addition to extreme
              poverty and inequality, has made it an ideal environment for gang
              recruitment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unrest within Ecuador&apos;s penitentiaries and an inefficient
              prison system that allows well-known criminals to evade justice
              have both substantially contributed to the rise in violence.

          On Tuesday, the travel aggregation app EaseMyTrip received a request

          Narendra Modi&apos;s visit to Lakshadweep.
        </p>
        <p>
          MATATO stated that they &quot;did not reflect sentiments of Maldivians
          in general&quot; and urged EaseMyTrip to ignore them. MATATO
          emphasized that Indian travelers are indispensable force in the
          success of the Maldivian tourism sector, providing vital support to
          small to medium-sized enterprises&quot; highlighting the need for
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a statement, the Maldives tourism board praised Indian visitors,
          who have become the country&apos;s largest group of foreign visitors
          since COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;As we offer our sincere thanks for the long-lasting friendship
          and cooperation that characterize the Maldives&apos; relationship with
          India, we want you to know that these ties go beyond issues of
          politics. We love and cherish our Indian counterparts as brothers and
          sisters.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With over two-thirds of the Maldives&apos; GDP coming from the
          tourism industry and 44,000 Maldivians employed in it, tourism is the
          lifeblood of the islands. The possible negative effect on tourism has
          the capacity to have catastrophic effects on our economy.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on information provided by the Maldives Tourism Ministry, over
          4.5 lakh Indian tourists have come to the nation over the previous two
          years, including over two lakh visitors last year. When the Maldives
          was still open to visitors, approximately 63,000 Indians went there
          despite the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, the Maldives Association of Tourism Industry (MATI) denounced
          remarks made disparagingly about Prime Minister Modi. MATATO also
          urged people to abstain from using offensive language that exacerbates
          division.

          &quot;There has been a noticeable increase in the number of people
          being duped by dubious and unlawful lending apps. Many people who
          become entangled in the network of these apps often turn to extreme
          measures, like suicide. Two new illicit lending apps appear for each
          one that is banned. It&apos;s turned into a whack-a-mole game,&quot;
          Kamath wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went on to discuss the strategies these apps employ to generate
          revenue. &quot;The fact that many of these apps deduct as much as 10%
          upfront is what makes them disgusting,&quot; he said. Furthermore,
          interest rates can vary from fifty percent to one hundred percent, or
          even higher. People that borrow money through these applications are
          unable to return it on such exorbitant terms. However, since that
          users of these apps are in need, they overlook the fine print.&quot;

        <p>
          He further warned individuals that these loan sharks may use physical
          threats in order to get money back at the conclusion of his tweet. By
          phoning all of their contacts and sharing their private images, they
          can also harass others.

              Seth and her son moved into a rented service apartment in
              Candolim, North Goa, on January 6.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following a few days of stay, Seth informed the apartment staff

            <p>
              Instead of hiring a taxi, which is an expensive option, the staff
              recommended that she take a flight to Bengaluru, which would be
              less expensive, the police officer said.
            </p>

              The woman insisted that she would only take a taxi, and on January

              right away.

              In addition, the staff reported to the police that Seth was seen
              carrying an abnormally heavy bag when she left the apartment and
              that her four-year-old son was not seen with her.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, she received a call from the police asking her about
              her missing son and the bloodstains.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response, the woman said that her monthly period was to blame
              for the bloodstains. She gave the address and mentioned that her
              son was in Margao town, South Goa, with her friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Naik, the police realized right away that the address
              she had provided was a fake after enlisting the assistance of the
              Fatorda Police (near Margao).
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, the taxi driver, who was traveling to Bengaluru and had
              arrived in the Karnataka district of Chitradurga, was instructed
              by the inspector over the phone to transport the accused person to
              the closest police station.

              According to Naik, when the Chitradurga police examined the

          This follows a controversy that started when a few Maldivian
          politicians disparaged Prime Minister Modi and made fun of his most
          recent trip to Lakshadweep. India brought up the issue with Male in a
          strong manner, and the leaders of the island nation&apos;s opposition
          criticized the ruling class for the disagreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maldivian deputy minister of youth empowerment, Mariyam Shiuna,
          made a derogatory and mocking reference to Prime Minister Modi in a
          post that has since been removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comments incited a fierce backlash in India. The Maldives
          government rejected the disparaging remarks, claiming they did not
          reflect Male&apos;s opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three deputy ministers were also suspended by the Maldivian government

          media. Ibrahim Khaleel, a spokesman for the Maldivian president,
          stated, &quot;All government officials responsible for the comments
          have been suspended from their post effective immediately.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the row, a number of well-known Indians, including cricketer
          Sachin Tendulkar, actor Akshay Kumar, actor Salman Khan, and actor
          Aakash Chopra, joined an online campaign advocating for a boycott of
          the Maldives and its tourist attractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amidst the boycott of the Maldives, online travel agency EaseMyTrip
          declared that &quot;country comes before business&quot; and that it
          would suspend all reservations for flights to the Maldives.

          PM Modi visited the union territory on January 2 and posted a number
          of photos, including one of him snorkelling, which he described as a
          &quot;exhilarating experience.&quot; PM Modi posted images of the
          ocean, snow-white beaches, and clear blue skies on X, captioning them
          with the words, &quot;Lakshadweep has to be on your list for those who
          wish to embrace the adventurer in them.&quot;

          The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Kyiv was using missiles made in the
          West to attack Russian targets, but it declined to comment on claims
          made by the US and Ukraine that Moscow had fired North Korean missiles
          at targets in Ukraine.

          The White House announced last week that Russia had launched several
          strikes against Ukraine using short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs)
          that were obtained from North Korea, citing recently declassified
          intelligence. Later on, a senior Ukrainian official confirmed the
          report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, both Moscow and Pyongyang
          have grown closer, despite their denials of having any arms deals. In
          September of last year, President Vladimir Putin and North Korean
          leader Kim Jong Un met in the Far East of Russia, and senior Russian
          officials have since visited Pyongyang multiple times.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about the allegations made by the United States and
          Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded, &quot;No
          comment&quot;, to a call with reporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peskov said that Ukraine had been using missiles made by
          &quot;Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and other
          countries&quot; to strike civilian targets inside Russia on multiple
          occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 30, an attack by Ukraine on the Russian border city of
          Belgorod resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including two
          children, and 111 injuries, according to Russian media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Belgorod region, which borders northern Ukraine, has experienced
          drone attacks and shelling this year, similar to other Russian border
          zones, which the authorities have attributed to Ukraine, though none
          had ever been this severe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stated goals of Moscow&apos;s Feb. 24, 2022, deployment of tens of
          thousands of troops into Ukraine were &quot;demilitarising&quot; and
          &quot;denazifying&quot; the nation. Moscow has stated that Western
          countries, including the US, are accountable for the fallout from
          arming Kyiv.

          After forty years, the greater one-horned rhinoceros has made a
          comeback to the Laokhowa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary in central
          Assam, according to officials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until 1983, there were at least 45 rhinos living in the 309.2 sq.
          km. wildlife sanctuary (WLS) in the Nagaon district, which is a part
          of the Greater Kaziranga landscape. Although stray rhinos from Orang
          National Park across the Brahmaputra River and the Kaziranga National
          Park to the east were known to briefly enter the WLS, widespread
          encroachment and poaching ultimately led to their extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the return of our famous rhinos to Laokhowa
          and Burachapori, after a 40-year absence, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa
          Sarma posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday night. Stating that
          they had returned within a year of our successful anti-encroachment
          operation in the area. He also mentioned that following the eviction
          drive in 2023, 51.7 square kilometers of forest cover had been
          recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to wildlife officials, the two rhinos are thought to have
          entered through Arimari, where between February 13 and 15, 2023,
          encroachers were removed from 1,282 hectares of forest land and 817
          hectares of unsurveyed government land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since November 2023, rhinos have been seen in Laokhowa-Burachapori, a
          great place for freshwater mangroves to live. The WLS also has ten
          tigers on file, suggesting a healthy base of herbivorous prey for
          these animals, according to Kaziranga&apos;s field director, Sonali
          Ghosh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent filling of 75 frontline positions and the recruitment of
          new personnel have been credited with increasing sanctuary protection.

          Editorial in China&apos;s official media — Global Times — discusses
          the growing diplomatic spat between India and the Maldives in the wake
          of insulting remarks made by Maldivian ministers against Prime
          Minister Narendra Modi.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It also respects the friendly and cooperative relationship

          to maintain good relations with New Delhi,&quot; reads the editorial
          in China&apos;s Global Times. Beijing does not see cooperation between
          the Maldives and India as hostile or dangerous, and it has never asked
          Male to reject New Delhi due to disputes between China and India,
          according to an editorial in the Global Times.

        <p>
          It went on to say: &quot;China is also open to implementing trilateral

              The Maldives and India have long had close relations. India was a

          The Maldives President&apos;s Office stated that H.E. Xi Jinping, the
          president of China, has invited this visit. When Muizzu arrived at the
          airport in Fujian, he was observed being welcomed by Chinese
          officials. President Xi Jinping of China has invited Muizzu and his
          spouse on a state visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Muizzu of the Maldives is on his first bilateral visit since
          taking office on December 17 of last year. Rumor has it that during
          Muizzu&apos;s visit, China and the Maldives will have formal
          discussions and sign important agreements to improve trade,
          professional growth, and socioeconomic cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Muizzu will also meet important Chinese business executives at the
          Invest Maldives Forum in Fuzhou. The President&apos;s Office of the
          Maldives released a statement saying, &quot;The visit aims to pave the
          way for technological and other collaborations between the two
          countries.&quot; The President and First Lady of the Maldives are
          accompanied by a high-level delegation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maldives President&apos;s Office stated, &quot;Additionally, the

          the Invest Maldives Forum, and have meetings with senior Chinese
          business leaders to explore avenues of mutual collaborations in
          investments and trade between the Maldives and China.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          On October 14, 1972, China and the Maldives established diplomatic
          relations. Since that time, China and the Maldives have made a
          concerted effort to strengthen their friendship.

          to biometric attendance and frisking after bathroom breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          NTA Director Subodh Kumar Singh stated, &quot;The goal of the action
          is to guarantee that there are no instances of unfair means or proxy
          attendance. We already have strict mechanisms in place, but the goal
          is to make the exam completely foolproof to ensure there are no
          incidents.&quot;

          width, and 380 feet long from east to west. The temple will have

          Social media was rocked by Maldivian politicians&apos; remarks about
          Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&apos;s visit to Lakshadweep, which

          Mohamed Muizzu, the recently elected president of the Maldives, has
          requested that India remove its troops from the island nation. The
          troops are in charge of three exquisite aircraft that are being used
          for patrol.
        </p>
        <p>
          What really infuriated Indians, though, were remarks made by
          politicians in the Maldives that were deemed racist. As a result, many
          Indians called for a boycott of travel to the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous well-known people have expressed their support for
          Modi&apos;s expedition and encouraged tourists to visit Indian
          islands.

            Maldives tourism is dominated by India

          <p>
            The tourism industry, which generates the majority of the
            country&apos;s foreign exchange earnings and government revenue, is
            a major contributor to the Maldivian economy. Due to its gorgeous
            beaches, opulent lodging options, and mouthwatering seafood, the
            island nation has become a popular travel destination in South Asia.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Maldivian Tourism Ministry reports that 161,751 arrivals from
          India were registered in November 2023 alone, making up nearly 20% of
          all arrivals. In the meantime, Indians held the second position in
          market share from January to November 2023, accounting for 10.9
          percent of all arrivals, or 181, 371 arrivals, in the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          India ranked as the fifth-largest country from which tourists arrived
          in the Maldives in 2018. Approximately 6.1% (more than 90,474) of the
          14,84,274 tourists came from India. Nevertheless, India ranked second
          in 2019 with 1,66,030 arrivals, nearly twice as many as the previous
          year. With almost 63,000 Indian tourists visiting the Maldives in the
          pandemic-hit year 2020, India accounted for the Maldives&apos; largest
          source market. With over 2.91 lakh and 2.41 lakh tourist arrivals from
          India, respectively, and a 23 percent and 14.4 percent market share,
          India remained the leading market in 2021 and 2022.

            Education, finance, and defense: India helps the Maldives
          </span>
          <p>
            India and the Maldives have collaborated closely in defense and
            security since 1988. Regarding meeting the Maldives&apos;
            requirements for defense hardware and training, India has been
            incredibly accommodating and adaptable. As of late, it has signed a
            comprehensive Action Plan for Defence in April 2016 and has
            continued to provide defense hardware, upgrade defense
            infrastructure, and train Maldivian forces.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Regarding financial support, the Maldives received an additional $100
          million in funding from the Modi administration in November 2022. The
          help came in the shape of budgetary support to help the archipelago
          nation get through its challenging economic times. It should be
          mentioned that the aid is being provided unconditionally, and the
          Maldives has been allowed to use it however it sees fit to aid in its
          economic recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          India further solidified its reputation as the “first responder” when
          it quickly sent 30,000 doses of the measles vaccine to the Maldives in
          January 2020 to stop an outbreak. India also provided the Maldives
          with prompt, all-encompassing assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, a number of young Maldivians attend Indian universities to
          pursue higher education. For many years, Maldivian schools located
          throughout the islands have employed Indian educators. Maldivian youth
          have historically been awarded a significant number of ICCR
          scholarships by India, specifically 39 for 2021-2022 and 34+ for
          2022-2023 & 2023-2024.

          opinions are personal and do not reflect the government&apos;s views.
        </p>

            There is very little plot protection for characters in this violent
            series; people can die, be consumed, beaten, tortured, shot,
            crushed, and more. But since it&apos;s an animated program, the
            violence isn&apos;t depicted any more graphically than it would be
            in a show like Game of Thrones. Characters are occasionally seen
            smoking and drinking wine, but these scenes don&apos;t have a
            recurring theme.
