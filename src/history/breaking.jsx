          Staff Sergeant Michelle Young, a 34-year-old US Army soldier and
          popular fitness influencer with over 100,000 Instagram followers,
          tragically died by suicide recently just days after her
          daughter&apos;s 12th birthday.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Young had served in the army for 16 years after enlisting at age 18.
          She completed two demanding tours in Afghanistan during her
          distinguished military career.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the days prior to her death, Young had posted a heartwarming
          birthday message for her daughter, writing &quot;Happy birthday to the
          sweetest girl I&apos;ve ever known. The best part about my life is
          being your momma.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond her army service, Young was passionate about volunteering
          during her free time. She worked as a crisis and trauma response
          volunteer, drawing from her own grief after her brother&apos;s
          suicide. She also volunteered at a local women&apos;s and
          children&apos;s homeless shelter.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          On her Instagram, Young often modeled athletic apparel from a company
          focused on female veterans. She was a vocal advocate for improving
          mental health treatment for veterans struggling with trauma. The exact
          circumstances that led to her tragic suicide remain unclear.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Young shared an extremely close bond with her 12-year-old daughter
          Gracie. The two had recently dressed up together as NFL star Travis
          Kelce and singer Taylor Swift. Her latest birthday post shows no hint
          of the inner turmoil Young must have been facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A GoFundMe page has been launched following Young&apos;s passing to
          support her daughter&apos;s future. &quot;Michelle was a beautiful
          soul, an amazing friend, a single mother, a soldier, and is proof you
          never know what someone is going through or what demons they may be
          fighting,&quot; it states.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;NOTHING can replace her mother, but the purpose of this is to
          help her daughter Gracie with anything she may need. We know Michelle
          would appreciate us all looking out for her now,&quot; the campaign
          adds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staff Sergeant Young&apos;s tragic death is a reminder that even
          seemingly happy, accomplished people can be fighting inner battles
          without outward signs. Her loss is devastating, especially for her
          beloved daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          While her motivation remains unclear, her passing highlights the
          urgent need to provide better mental health support for veterans
          dealing with the aftereffects of trauma. If someone like Young can
          succumb to darkness, it shows much work remains to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As her friends said, Young was an inspiration to many. Honoring her
          memory means being proactive in checking on the wellbeing of veterans
          and offering help before it&apos;s too late. Preventing even one
          suicide would be the greatest tribute to her life of selfless service.

          The festive town welcomed many visitors, with the event starting
          shortly after noon on Monday. Prime Minister Modi will arrive in
          Ayodhya at 10:45 am and be at the temple site by 10:55 am to
          participate in the ceremonies from 12:05 pm to 12:55 pm. He will then
          address a public gathering before visiting the Kuber Tila to offer
          prayers at the renovated Shiva temple and unveil a Jatayu statue.

          A major part of the preparatory rituals that began on January 16th
          concluded on Sunday. The day started with the new 51-inch idol being
          covered with honey during the &apos;Madhvadhivas&apos; ritual. It was
          then bathed with medicated water from 114 urns as part of
          &apos;Snapan&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old idol was also taken around the new temple in a decorated
          palanquin before being brought inside. As the rituals continued into
          Sunday evening, the priests said the eyes of the new idol, which were
          closed on January 16th, will be opened after another purificatory
          bath. It will then be shown a mirror to absorb energies created by the
          rituals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ghee and honey will also be applied to the eyes with a gold stick. The
          old idol will be similarly bathed and both idols placed inside the
          sanctum sanctorum. The preparatory rituals ended with
          &apos;Shayandhivas&apos;, symbolically putting the idol to sleep after
          six days of worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quilts from Jaipur and a carved sheesham bed adorned the idol on
          Sunday night. On Monday morning, priests will arrive by 8:30 am to
          complete the remaining rites. The sacred fire will continue burning
          even after the ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consecration of the new Ram Lalla idol marks the fulfillment of a
          decades-old movement. The festivities reflect the devout fervor
          sweeping Ayodhya as this historic moment arrives after years of
          anticipation. PM Modi&apos;s attendance underscores its importance for
          the nation.

          The Union Law Ministry stated on Sunday that a majority of the over
          20,000 responses received by the high-level committee on &apos;One
          Nation, One Election&apos; were in favor of holding simultaneous
          polls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The committee, chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind, held its
          third meeting on January 22nd. It had invited public suggestions
          through a notice on January 5th, with a deadline of January 15th.
          Feedback was also collected via the committee&apos;s website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of 20,972 total responses, 81% supported the idea of simultaneous
          elections across the country. The committee had also sought inputs
          from 46 political parties, out of which 17 have submitted their
          suggestions so far. The Election Commission of India&apos;s views were
          also recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week, Kovind held consultations with former Chief Election
          Commissioners Sushil Chandra and O.P. Rawat, former Madras High Court
          Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, and former Delhi High Court
          Chief Justice G. Rohini. This was part of engaging with eminent
          jurists, ex-Supreme Court and High Court judges, past Chief Election
          Commissioners, and industry bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ministry stated that the committee will hold its next meeting on
          January 27th. The panel was set up last September by the Law Ministry
          and has held two previous meetings. Its mandate is to examine and
          recommend holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha, state
          assemblies, local bodies and panchayats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The move towards &apos;One Nation, One Election&apos; requires
          consensus among political parties. Critics have raised concerns about
          its feasibility in India&apos;s complex federal structure. But
          advocates argue it will cut election costs and provide policy
          continuity at the Centre and states.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a majority of public responses in favor, the committee has a
          strong endorsement for deliberating further reforms. Its
          recommendations will be crucial to build political and public
          acceptance for simultaneous polls. But implementing One Nation, One
          Election will ultimately need Constitutional amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Law Ministry panel represents the government&apos;s most concrete
          step yet towards this long-pending electoral reform. Its consultative
          approach is welcome. Achieving simultaneous national and state
          elections will be challenging, but may strengthen governance in the
          long run if implemented judiciously.

          Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a key meeting in Raipur on Sunday to
          review the efforts to curb Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in Chhattisgarh.
          The objective is to eliminate the Maoist threat in the state within
          three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In attendance were the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Ministers, the
          Union Home Secretary, Intelligence Bureau Director, CRPF Director
          General, Chhattisgarh Chief Secretary, and the state police chief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah noted that joint efforts by central and state security forces
          have contained Maoist activities to some pockets. But a targeted plan
          is now needed to dismantle the entire support ecosystem of the rebels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Home Minister directed the state police to boost security, conduct
          thorough probes, closely monitor court cases, choke funding channels
          and continue intelligence-based operations. He stressed
          operationalizing all actionable inputs shared through the Multi-Agency
          Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah underlined the need to ensure complete coverage of central and
          state welfare schemes in Maoist-hit districts. He said the Home
          Ministry should allow flexibility in allotting and utilizing funds in
          these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Home Minister emphasized sensitively addressing all legitimate
          grievances of locals regarding entitlements. Following this, the Union
          Home Secretary interacted in detail with district police chiefs and
          administrators of the worst LWE-hit districts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-level meeting reflects the resolve to decisively end
          left-wing extremism in Chhattisgarh. The state has seen some of the
          deadliest Maoist attacks in the past decade despite sustained
          counter-insurgency efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah&apos;s emphasis on choking funding channels is critical as
          extortion remains a big source of income for Maoists. Strengthening
          local governance delivery will be equally important to wean away
          popular support from rebels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chhattisgarh police have the experience and motivation needed for the
          final push against extremists. Central assistance can plug gaps in
          resources and capabilities. But ultimately, the key will lie in
          granular, district-specific plans rooted in local realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much progress has been made, but the last mile will be the toughest.
          Concerted action across multiple fronts in the coming years can help
          fulfill the Home Minister&apos;s vision of making Chhattisgarh
          Maoist-free. It will require political will, administrative
          coordination and security force professionalism.

          The eleven men convicted for the 2002 gang rape of Bilkis Bano and
          murder of her family members turned themselves in to authorities late
          Sunday night at the Godhra jail. This comes after the Supreme Court
          revoked the premature release granted to them by the Gujarat
          government on August 15th last year and ordered them to surrender
          within two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eleven men - Radheshyam Shah, Jaswant Nai, Govind Nai, Kesar
          Vohania, Baka Vohania, Raju Soni, Ramesh Chandana, Shailesh Bhatt,
          Bipin Joshi, Pradip Modhiya, and Mitesh Bhatt - arrived at the jail in
          Godhra from Singwad village in two separate vehicles shortly before
          midnight. Most came in a ten-seater van led by an SUV. The district
          police confirmed they had monitored and escorted the men into the
          jail.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for the surrender, police units were deployed outside
          the jail since Sunday evening. The jail authorities verified that the
          eleven men turned themselves in at 11:45pm on Sunday, just meeting the
          Supreme Court&apos;s stipulated deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes after the Supreme Court dismissed petitions from the men
          earlier last week asking for more time to surrender. They had cited
          reasons like caring for elderly parents, an upcoming wedding, and
          needing to harvest crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          On January 8th, the Supreme Court overturned the Gujarat
          government&apos;s decision to grant remission and release the men.
          They had been sentenced to life in prison for the rape of Bano and
          murder of her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Court
          ruled that the Gujarat government lacked the authority to grant
          remission, which should have been decided by the Maharashtra
          government.
        </p>
        <p>
          The men were originally released on August 15th under Gujarat&apos;s
          1992 remission policy based on a Supreme Court order in May 2022 in a
          petition filed by one of the convicts, Radheshyam Shah. Bano
          challenged the release, leading to the January 8th ruling reversing
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was raped by
          multiple men as she fled riot violence in 2002, which also claimed the
          lives of 14 of her family members including her three-year-old
          daughter. By ordering the men to surrender, the Supreme Court has
          provided a measure of justice to Bano after nearly two decades.

        <p>
          Vector control and disease surveillance measures have been implemented
          to prevent any outbreaks. While mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue
          are uncommon in winter, respiratory infections from Covid-19 and
          influenza have risen across Indian cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to on-site facilities, the bed capacity at the local
          medical college has been increased from 350 to 550 beds as backup.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government&apos;s portable Arogya Maitri BHISM emergency hospital
          with medical cubes is on standby if required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hospitals in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and neighbouring states have been
          alerted to remain on standby for unforeseen emergencies. A designated
          team is ready for rapid deployment, the Health Ministry stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ministry is also enhancing health facilities at the Ayodhya
          airport.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, elaborate medical arrangements including field hospitals,
          first-aid booths, disease surveillance, backup beds, portable
          emergency infrastructure and trained personnel have been deployed in
          Ayodhya ahead of the high-profile temple ceremony expecting massive
          crowds.

          RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has appealed for an end to the
          &quot;bitterness&quot;, &quot;dispute&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot;
          surrounding the issue.

          conflict,&quot; he stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagwat said the temple consecration marks the &quot;beginning of
          rebuilding Bharatvarsh&quot;. Along with reconstructing the temple, we
          have pledged to rebuild India and thereby pave the way to reconstruct
          the entire world, he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blaming &quot;politics of appeasement&quot;, he said that after
          independence, the unanimous renovation of Somnath temple sparked
          discussions about other places of worship. A similar consensus could
          have been reached regarding Ram Janmabhoomi, but politics took a
          different turn with the rise of discrimination and appeasement. So the
          issue remained unresolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successive governments disregarded the wishes and sentiments of Hindus
          on this matter. Instead they tried to thwart initiatives taken by
          society. The legal battle dating back to pre-independence times
          continued. The mass movement demanding liberation of Ram&apos;s
          birthplace began in the 1980s and went on for 30 years, he pointed
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagwat said India&apos;s history is one of constant struggle against
          invaders for the past 1500 years. Attacks by Islamist forces from the
          West brought utter destruction and fractured society. Destroying
          native religious sites was key to demoralizing the nation and
          community. Foreign conquerors razed temples in India repeatedly for
          this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demolishing Ram temple in Ayodhya had the same motive of subjugating
          India by weakening society, he stated. However the strategy did not
          succeed. Faith, commitment and morale of Indians never diminished.
          Resistance continued. Repeated attempts were made to regain the
          birthplace and rebuild the temple, through many wars and sacrifices.
          The Ram Janmabhoomi issue remained etched in Hindu minds, Bhagwat
          emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recalling that Hindus and Muslims jointly fought the British in 1857,
          he said there was a chance for reconciliation by banning cow slaughter
          and freeing Ram&apos;s birthplace. Bahadur Shah Zafar guaranteed a cow
          slaughter ban, uniting society against the British. Though the war
          failed, the temple struggle persisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagwat recounted that Ram&apos;s idol appeared at the site in 1949.
          The temple was unlocked by court order in 1986. The Hindu
          society&apos;s campaigns and efforts went on, culminating in the
          balanced Supreme Court verdict of 2019 after 134 years of legal
          battle. Now, on January 22nd, the installation ceremony will be held,
          he stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temple marks the revival of national pride and modern society
          accepting Ram&apos;s values, he said. Bhagwat urged adopting
          Ram&apos;s virtues - integrity, bravery with forgiveness, sincerity,
          humility, compassion, duty focussed strictness. This will require
          honest hard work from all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the RSS chief hailed the temple while calling for communal
          harmony, saying Ram embodied virtues that all should imbibe. He
          recounted the history of temple struggles and court battles. The
          consecration marks cultural reawakening and upholding values,
          according to him.

          Less than 48 hours before the scheduled consecration on January 22nd,
          an elaborate set of rituals involving the new 51-inch idol of Ram
          Lalla were completed on Saturday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes of the new idol, still covered in cloth, underwent various
          &quot;adhivas&quot; rituals which involved draping the entire frame
          with a variety of flowers brought from across India including Tamil
          Nadu, Maharashtra and Kolkata, according to sources involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          These flowers, estimated at 50 kg, included lotus, rose, jasmine and
          chrysanthemum.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a 3 hour ritual called &quot;snapan&quot;, the inner sanctum was
          also washed with water from 81 &quot;Kalash&quot; or urns sourced from
          various religious sites and rivers across India, including Sitamarhi
          in Bihar and Nepal, regarded as Sita&apos;s birthplace. Some urns
          contained medicated water with cow urine and juices of select fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for Monday, public viewing or &quot;darshan&quot; of
          the old Ram Lalla idol at the makeshift temple was halted. It will be
          moved to the inner sanctum on Sunday evening and its viewing is likely
          to resume from January 23rd along with that of the new idol, stated
          Satyendra Das, priest of Ram Lalla.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rituals on Sunday included &quot;Shakradhivas&quot;,
          &quot;Phaladhivas&quot; and &quot;Pushpadhivas&quot;, offering the
          idol sugar and sweets, fruits and then flowers respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the ritual fire ceremony that began on Friday continued
          into the evening around the mandap, about 100 meters from the temple
          site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, elaborate rituals were completed around the new Ram Lalla
          idol less than 48 hours before its consecration. Public viewing of the
          old idol was stopped in preparation for installing the new idol on
          January 22nd. The rituals involved bathing, as well as offerings of
          flowers, fruits and sweets to the deity.

          The day following the December 21st terrorist attack on an army convoy
          in Poonch, where four soldiers lost their lives, reports have emerged
          of alleged detention and torture of civilians by security personnel.

          five civilians from the same village have claimed they endured torture
          and unlawful detention as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incidents occurred despite assurances of justice by high ranking
          officials like Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Army Chief Manoj
          Pande during visits to the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is understood that the Jammu and Kashmir police have requested the
          army to furnish medical documents concerning the five hospitalized men
          - Riaz (25) and his brother Farooq (19), along with Israel (20),
          Jameel (18) and Irfan (18). A senior police officer stated that the
          records are required to produce the victims before a judicial
          magistrate and document their statements, as part of the investigation
          into the deaths. The five men are considered eyewitnesses, as they
          were reportedly detained alongside the deceased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wazir Hussain, father of Riaz and Farooq, revealed that his family
          received Rs 2.5 lakhs in compensation for each son – Rs 1 lakh from
          the civil administration and Rs 1.5 lakhs from the army when they were
          discharged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mehmood Bhat, the former village head of Topa Pir, corroborated that
          he assisted the families in obtaining compensation cheques from the
          authorities. The army spokesperson declined to comment regarding the
          five hospitalized men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ambush of army vehicles occurred between Dehra Ki Gali and Bufliaz
          on the Mughal road. The following morning, eight civilians were
          allegedly detained from Topa Pir in the Bufliaz area of Poonch
          district, along with five more from Thanamandi in Rajouri district.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the eight people from Topa Pir, three – Shabir Ahmed (30), Safeer
          Ahmed (45) and Mohammad Showkat (22) – passed away due to injuries
          purportedly sustained from torture. After pleas from locals that the
          others would die without medical intervention, they were admitted to a
          hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to reports, Israel, one of the five detainees from Topa Pir,
          claimed he received a summons to report to an army post around 11:30
          am on December 22nd. He alleged being stripped and beaten with batons
          and iron rods until losing consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Israel stated that Showkat, Shabir, Safeer and Riaz were already
          detained at the camp, while Farooq, Jameel and Irfan were brought in
          later. “We were dragged outside and revived with water before more
          torture,” he recounted, adding they were finally moved to an army
          facility where he regained consciousness that night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the others, Israel maintained he was given Rs 1 lakh by the
          Poonch District Collector and Rs 1.5 lakhs by the army upon discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wazir Hussain alleged his sons’ skin had darkened from the abuse. He
          said he bought them new clothes and shoes in Surankote since they had
          been stripped prior to the ill-treatment and lacked garments when
          hospitalized. &quot;Their current attire was donated by others,&quot;
          he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 27th, Defense Minister Singh and Army Chief General Pande
          visited Rajouri district and met with the families of the deceased
          civilians. As per the bereaved, the Minister promised justice would be
          served.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, addressing troops, Singh remarked that along with defending the
          nation, they also shoulder the huge responsibility of winning the
          hearts of countrymen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rajnath had additionally interacted with the five detainees from
          Thanamandi at the Government Medical College, Rajouri. Discharged
          between January 2nd and 6th, they were identified as Mohammad Ashraf
          (52), Farooq Ahmed (45), Fazal Hussain (50) and his nephews Mohammad
          Betab (25) and a 15-year-old. Each received Rs 3 lakhs in
          compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The J&K administration announced Rs 20 lakhs in compensation for
          families of the deceased, along with a land parcel and government job
          for one member. The army provided Rs 10 lakhs ex-gratia.

        <p>
          The Indian Embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has invited
          Badruddin Haqqani, the envoy for the Taliban, to attend the Republic
          Day celebrations in Abu Dhabi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Badruddin Haqqani, one of the sons of Jalaluddin Haqqani, was
          appointed as Ambassador in October 2023. His brother, Sirajuddin
          Haqqani, serves as the Interior Minister of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Haqqani network, comprised of prominent Taliban leaders, was
          involved in several terrorist attacks including the 2008 attack on the
          Indian Embassy in Kabul.
        </p>
        <p>
          A copy of the invitation, issued by Indian Ambassador to UAE Sunjay
          Sudhir, was shared on Twitter by Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary, now
          based outside of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          New Delhi&apos;s perspective is that the Indian government has been
          engaging with the Taliban since it sent a technical team and reopened
          the Indian Embassy in Kabul. Thus, inviting Badruddin Haqqani aligns
          with that approach, sources said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources said the invitation was addressed to the envoy of the
          &quot;Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.&quot; The Taliban refers to
          itself as the &quot;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan;&quot; the
          &quot;Islamic Republic of Afghanistan&quot; was represented by former
          President Ashraf Ghani.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carefully navigating the issue, India has been engaging with the
          Taliban in Kabul but has not yet granted diplomatic recognition to the
          Taliban regime. The Indian government is following the template of the
          international community - engaging with the Taliban without officially
          recognizing them per UN standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afghanistan&apos;s Consuls General in Mumbai and Hyderabad announced
          in November 2022 that they would keep the Afghan Embassy in New Delhi
          open and operational – its closure was announced by Farid Mamundzay,
          the ousted government’s Ambassador to India, who termed the Consuls
          General as Taliban representatives. Given this, India is examining
          three key indicators that do not amount to India&apos;s de facto
          recognition of the Taliban regime:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the new leadership will continue flying the Islamic Republic of
          Afghanistan&apos;s tricolor flag, not the Taliban&apos;s white flag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the Embassy will retain the old name - the Islamic Republic of
          Afghanistan, instead of the Taliban’s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, no new Taliban-appointed diplomats will join the Afghan Embassy
          in Delhi or the consulates in Mumbai and Hyderabad.
        </p>
        <p>
          India’s red lines were conveyed to the new team, and the Afghan
          Consuls General have promised officials in India&apos;s Ministry of
          External Affairs that they will comply.
        </p>
        <p>
          India has been cautious, not labeling them Taliban representatives if
          they adhere to these commitments.

          obtain a valid entry pass for the ceremony. Scanners will be set up at
          the pilgrimage facility to print the passes. Pre-registration through
          the online link sent to invitees along with their invitation, plus
          carrying an Aadhaar card, will be mandatory.

          Many elderly saints, seers and citizens may struggle with the online
          registration process. To assist them, the district administration has
          established help desks in coordination with the trust. Individuals
          arriving with just the physical invitation will be aided by volunteers
          at these help desks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The district administration is also verifying the credentials of all
          invitees upon their arrival in Ayodhya on or before January 22nd. This
          additional layer of authentication ensures smooth entry for approved
          guests on the day of the historic inauguration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, preparations are underway to welcome Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi to the city. Hoardings displaying central government
          schemes will line the Ram Path and Lucknow-Ayodhya highway. Around 300
          large hoardings will be installed between Sahadatganj and Lata Chowk
          to showcase flagship initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Saturday evening onwards, volunteers will begin decorating the
          Janmabhoomi Path. Ongoing civil works along the path will be halted
          from Saturday night onwards. The goal is completing all arrangements
          in time for the high-profile ceremony on January 22nd.
        </p>
        <p>
          The special security and access protocols demonstrate meticulous
          planning by the district administration to handle the large
          anticipated crowds. The QR code and online pre-registration
          requirements will facilitate organized entry of approved attendees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional steps like credential verification and assistive help desks
          will ensure invited saintly figures and elderly guests are not
          inconvenienced. Smooth access for VIPs like the Prime Minister has
          also been planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          It underscores the significance of making this historic occasion
          seamless for all dignitaries as well as common devotees. With prudent
          advanced planning, the administration hopes to make the inauguration
          ceremony memorable and accessible for diverse attendees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The occasion carries huge spiritual and symbolic meaning for Hindus
          globally. The access protocols aim to uphold the sanctity and
          solemnity of this once-in-a-lifetime event at the new temple site in
          Ayodhya.

          Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik has announced his second marriage to
          Pakistani actor Sana Javed. The couple confirmed the news by posting
          photos on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Malik was previously married to Indian tennis star Sania Mirza. The
          former couple have a five-year-old son named Izhaan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Days before Malik&apos;s remarriage, Sania had shared a cryptic
          Instagram quote about divorce being difficult but necessary at times.
          It spoke about choosing your hardships wisely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sania and Malik married in 2010 and lived together in the UAE.
          Meanwhile, Sana Javed was earlier married to singer Umar Jaswal in
          2020 before separating in November 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Sania, the news comes after she retired last year from a stellar
          20-year professional tennis career. The trailblazing Indian player
          captured 43 WTA doubles titles and one singles title.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 37-year-old is renowned for six Grand Slam championships,
          including three women&apos;s doubles titles with Swiss great Martina
          Hingis. Sania also won two of her three mixed doubles Slams with
          fellow Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, and one with Bruno Soares.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, she began a new chapter as mentor for the Royal Challengers
          Bangalore franchise in the inaugural Women&apos;s Premier League. Her
          retirement cemented a legacy as one of India&apos;s greatest ever
          tennis athletes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Shoaib Malik continues plying his trade in T20 leagues
          globally. The veteran has not yet retired from cricket&apos;s shortest
          format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sania&apos;s enigmatic social media post indicates the dissolution of
          her high-profile relationship with Malik. Her oblique reference to the
          difficulties of divorce shows the personal challenges during this new
          phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          For both sports stars, intense media glare has long accompanied their
          careers. This latest development will draw its own share of fevered
          speculation around the reasons for their split after 12 years of
          marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, their primary focus will be navigating this transition
          sensitively while protecting their young son&apos;s wellbeing. For
          Sania, who has broken barriers for female athletes, new possibilities
          may unfold after a monumental tennis career.
        </p>
        <p>
          She can reflect proudly on her trailblazing achievements on and off
          the court. This next chapter will reveal how she approaches
          life&apos;s complex hurdles with the same champion&apos;s resilience
          that defined her historic sporting journey.

          Microsoft has revealed that the same elite Russian hacking group
          responsible for the massive SolarWinds breach in 2020-2021 has
          recently targeted the technology giant in a new cyber espionage
          operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a January 2024 blog post, Microsoft said the incursion by the
          notorious state-sponsored Russian group dubbed Midnight Blizzard began
          in late November 2022 and was detected on January 12th. Only a small
          subset of Microsoft corporate accounts were breached, with some emails
          and attachments stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the compromised accounts were members of Microsoft’s senior
          leadership and staff in cybersecurity, legal, and other key units.
          Microsoft’s threat research team attributed the attack without doubt
          to Midnight Blizzard, known by researchers as APT29, Nobelium, or Cozy
          Bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team determined the primary motive was to gain intelligence on
          what Microsoft knew about the group&apos;s past and ongoing
          activities. The initial entry point was a “password spray attack” in
          November exploiting a Microsoft platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique involves trying a single compromised password across
          many related accounts to sneak into a target network. Microsoft stated
          no specific product or service vulnerability was exploited.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far there is no evidence the hackers accessed customer data,
          production systems, source code, or AI assets, the company emphasized.
          The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for
          comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Midnight Blizzard is linked to Russia&apos;s SVR foreign intelligence
          service according to U.S. officials. The elite hacker group is best
          known for infiltrating the Democratic National Committee before the
          2016 elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft software is ubiquitous across the U.S. government, and the
          company faced criticism last year when Chinese hackers stole senior
          State Department officials&apos; emails due to security practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before updating its threat naming in 2022, Microsoft called this same
          Russian group Nobelium. Cyber firm Mandiant dubs them Cozy Bear. In
          2021 Microsoft described the SolarWinds campaign as the most advanced
          nation-state cyberattack ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          It compromised over 100 private sector companies and government
          agencies in addition to US Justice and Treasury departments by
          hijacking widely-used network management software.
        </p>
        <p>
          This latest electronic intrusion highlights the constant threat posed
          by sophisticated, well-resourced nation-state hackers to all
          organizations according to Microsoft. It demonstrates Russia’s
          relentless drive to illegally acquire sensitive data for strategic
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the attack was detected and contained quickly, it underscores
          no entity is immune from targeting by groups like Midnight Blizzard
          with the backing of foreign governments. Continuous vigilance and
          proactive defense is required to protect institutional networks and
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft was specifically picked due to its visibility into
          cybersecurity threats and countermeasures. By understanding what and
          how much Microsoft knew about their past operations, the hackers could
          refine future tradecraft and targeting to avoid detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          This case illustrates the Spy vs. Spy nature of nation-state cyber
          espionage where major technology providers are both key targets and
          threats to avoid. It also shows no organization can afford to let its
          guard down against elite adversarial hacking given the stakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vigilance and resilience helped Microsoft detect and respond quickly
          to contain the latest Midnight Blizzard operation. But it remains a
          reminder that Russia-backed groups are actively looking to penetrate
          private and public sector networks to fulfill Kremlin intelligence
          priorities and agendas.

          The case of Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national accused by American
          authorities of involvement in a failed assassination plot, has taken a
          new turn. Gupta was arrested in Prague last June and the United States
          is seeking his extradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Czech judicial authorities, the Prague High Court has
          ruled that the Czech Republic can legally extradite Gupta to the US to
          face charges there. This judgment upholds an earlier decision by a
          lower Czech court permitting extradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charges against Gupta were filed in November 2022 by federal
          prosecutors in New York. He is accused of conspiring with an Indian
          government employee to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a separatist Sikh
          nationalist living in the United States. Pannun holds dual American
          and Canadian citizenship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alleged assassination plot was uncovered and prevented from being
          carried out. Gupta has been detained in the Czech Republic since his
          arrest while awaiting the outcome of extradition proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following standard protocol, the Prague High Court&apos;s ruling will
          now be forwarded to the Czech Justice Ministry along with the full
          case file. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek will make the final
          determination on whether Gupta can be extradited to America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minister Blažek could potentially have doubts about the high
          court&apos;s decision, in which case he can ask the Supreme Court to
          review the matter within three months. But the timeframe for a final
          extradition decision remains uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a spokesperson, the requested person, Gupta, can be
          expected to exploit all available legal means to halt the extradition
          process. Earlier, Gupta&apos;s defense lawyer filed an appeal
          contesting his client&apos;s identity and arguing the case is
          politically motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The appeals court has now rejected that appeal, clearing the path for
          the justice minister to approve the extradition request. Gupta&apos;s
          attorney has suggested they may take the case to the Constitutional
          Court as a last resort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, the defense lawyer alleged human rights violations against
          Gupta in Czech custody, including extended solitary confinement. Court
          documents filed in January claimed Gupta was last in the United States
          in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          American authorities, however, believe Gupta worked with an Indian
          government employee to hatch the failed plot against Pannun sometime
          before his arrest last summer. The indictment alleges they conspired
          to kill Pannun on US soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case has generated interest given the intrigue surrounding the
          transnational assassination plot and the involvement of intelligence
          agencies. Gupta&apos;s ultimate fate now lies in the hands of Czech
          judicial authorities who will decide if the evidence merits
          extraditing him to stand trial in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          This new development marks the latest twist in an ongoing legal saga
          playing out across multiple countries. The final chapter remains
          uncertain, but progress has been made towards potentially extraditing
          Gupta to face charges relating to the alleged murder conspiracy.

          The partial shutdown of one of the world&apos;s busiest airports is an
          annual measure taken amid heightened security prior to R-Day
          celebrations. Coming after weeks of fog-related flight delays,
          diversions and cancellations, the 145-minute daily closure could
          further disrupt airlines&apos; schedules.

          Chaotic scenes were witnessed recently due to extreme fog, including
          the shocking assault of an IndiGo pilot by a frustrated passenger
          after a 13-hour delay on a Delhi-Goa flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia announced a 6-point plan this
          week to mitigate fog disruptions, including new SOPs for airlines and

        </p>

          As part of security measures, Delhi Police has banned paragliders,
          hang gliders, microlights, drones, balloons and other flying objects
          till February 15th. Para jumping or parachuting is also prohibited.

          The R-Day restrictions aim to secure airspace in the capital during
          the high-profile event and are as per protocol. However, authorities
          must balance security with minimal impact on the public and air
          travellers. The recent fog chaos has highlighted the urgent need to
          upgrade aviation infrastructure and technology to make operations
          all-weather resistant.
        </p>
        <p>
          R-Day celebrates India&apos;s democratic spirit amidst tightened
          security and restrictions. But citizens must retain liberty, mobility
          and convenience to the extent possible rather than be subjected to
          overzealous curtailments each year. Collaborative measures between
          security forces, airports and airlines can enhance safeguards while
          ensuring smooth operations and services.

          Chants and prayers filled the air as the Ram Lalla idol was
          respectfully placed in the inner sanctum. Consecration rituals
          commenced on January 12th. Sources say PM Modi will perform the Pran
          Pratishtha puja on the 23rd to complete the consecration rites.
        </p>
        <p>
          A team of priests led by Lakshmikant Dixit will perform the main Pran
          Pratishtha rituals. PM Modi is strictly adhering to prescribed rules
          ahead of his participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources share that the PM is sleeping on the floor with just a
          blanket, only drinking coconut water. He has asked the public not to
          visit Ayodhya on the 22nd to avoid inconveniencing Lord Ram,
          suggesting they come from the 23rd onwards instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          PM Modi also called on every Indian household to light a diya on
          January 22nd to be part of the ceremony spiritually. Over 11,000
          specially invited guests from India and abroad will physically attend
          the momentous event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idol&apos;s installation marks a key milestone in the
          temple&apos;s construction. The consecration rites will imbue the
          deity with divine presence. PM Modi&apos;s observance of preparatory
          rituals reflects his commitment to tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          His appeal to celebrate nationally with diyas rather than crowding
          Ayodhya demonstrates thoughtful leadership upholding Lord Ram&apos;s
          ideals. The grand temple&apos;s consecration will be a historic
          moment, fulfilling devotees&apos; centuries-long wait to offer worship
          there.

          Last week, the Hyderabad police made a major bust by arresting Rakesh
          Jain and Mahaveer Jain for illegally manufacturing and selling
          counterfeit Mysore Sandal soaps. This fraudulent operation had been
          running for nearly a decade across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and the
          Hyderabad-Karnataka region, causing estimated losses of Rs 500-600
          crore to the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL) - the
          legitimate producer of Mysore Sandal soap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tip-off came from an anonymous message received by Karnataka
          Industries Minister M B Patil, who also chairs the KSDL. Acting on
          this lead, KSDL staff in Secunderabad purchased over Rs 5 lakh worth
          of fake soaps for testing, proving they were counterfeit. However,
          details on the manufacturers remained scant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cunning plan was hatched - a large Rs 25 lakh order was placed for
          the fake soaps as a pretense for visiting the secret manufacturing
          facility. This enabled the perpetrators to finally be identified and
          arrested. Investigations suggest the counterfeit operation
          specifically targeted religious events and tourist destinations where
          buyers may be less discerning about product authenticity. With
          estimated annual turnover of Rs 60 crore, it was a highly lucrative
          business built on deceit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scam worked by offering retailers substantially higher commissions
          than the genuine product, creating strong financial incentives to
          peddle the fake soaps. A 75g bar of real Mysore Sandal soap earns
          retailers minimal margin, but the counterfeits were sold at less than
          half price, generating huge profits. Similarly, boxes of 3 x 450g
          genuine soaps provide Rs 10 margin, but the fakes offered Rs 50 - a
          five-fold increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lab tests by KSDL revealed the counterfeit soaps contained dangerous
          heavy metals that could cause cancer. Genuine boxes have holograms, so
          lack of this security feature is a clear visual indicator of fakes.
          The criminals had exploited relaxed scrutiny of brands at religious
          fairs and festivals to pass off the hazardous products.
        </p>
        <p>
          A political angle also emerged, with allegations that the Jain
          brothers had links to local BJP leaders Manikant Rathod and Vittal
          Nayak. Photographs showing the accused with UP CM Yogi Adityanath and
          Telangana BJP MLA Raja Singh were revealed by Minister Priyank Kharge
          at a press conference. However, the BJP leaders strongly denied any
          connection to the crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, a KSDL corruption scandal surfaced last year when
          former BJP MLA and KSDL chairman Madal Virupakshappa&apos;s son
          Prashanth was caught collecting bribes for supply contracts. A raid on
          his premises uncovered a massive Rs 8.20 crore of unaccounted cash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent arrests prove more work is required to tackle the
          counterfeit trade which allows unscrupulous businesses to profit
          through deception and potentially harm public health. Tougher
          penalties and consumer education may help, but eliminating corrupt
          political connections will be key to effectively shutting down these
          dangerous fake networks for good.

          Police in Kerala arrested a 59-year-old Pentecostal pastor on Friday
          for the alleged sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy. The incident
          occurred this past Wednesday in a district in the southern region of
          the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to authorities, the pastor allegedly lured the vulnerable
          minor into a trap and sexually abused him. The young boy had been
          abandoned by his mother and was waiting for his grandmother, who had
          gone to the hospital, when the pastor approached him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identified as Raveendranath, the pastor invited the boy to his home
          after gaining his trust. At the residence, the pastor allegedly served
          the child cake before showing him pornographic images on a tablet
          device. Raveendranath then sexually assaulted the boy, as per the
          police complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accused has been booked under the Protection of Children from
          Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act based on the child&apos;s testimony. This
          law aims to deter and punish sexual crimes against minors.
        </p>
        <p>
          After being arrested, Raveendranath was produced before a magistrate
          who ordered he be placed in judicial custody pending trial. As the
          allegations involve abuse of a child who had been abandoned, the
          police will be investigating whether the pastor identified and
          targeted the vulnerable boy in a predatory manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith leaders wielding influence over followers and having
          unsupervised access to minors must uphold the highest moral and
          ethical standards. This duty becomes even more onerous when engaging
          with children who lack parental care or support networks. Violating
          this trust can leave deep emotional and psychological scars, as
          evidenced by numerous cases of clergy abuse worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authorities have stated that the mental health and safety of the
          survivor are the primary concerns during trial, and counselling will
          be provided if required. The community must also reflect on how to
          prevent such exploitation of society&apos;s most vulnerable members.

          A shocking case of road rage occurred in Delhi&apos;s Janakpuri area
          on Wednesday morning, where a 22-year-old man was shot and injured by
          two men after his car accidentally brushed against their motorcycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to police reports, the victim, Jatin Jain, was with a female
          friend when the incident took place. While parking his car near a
          district center, it slightly collided with a motorcycle belonging to
          the two accused men. An intense argument broke out between Jain and
          the men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, when Jain and his friend crossed the road on her scooter, the
          accused allegedly followed them and demanded they stop. Another heated
          exchange occurred, after which one of the men pulled out a pistol and
          fired at Jain, with the bullet striking his left hip. Jain&apos;s
          friend fortunately escaped unharmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the accused, identified as Vishal Rai, was arrested at the
          scene by a nearby police patrol that rushed over after hearing the
          gunshot. However, Rai&apos;s associate managed to flee initially and
          was absconding.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Vichitra Veer,
          locals also hurried to help the injured Jain as his friend screamed
          for assistance, providing cover from the hostile men. Police recovered
          the pistol used in the attack from the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials revealed Rai has a criminal background with over eight prior
          cases related to arms and ammunition, theft, and robbery charges. The
          injured Jain was transported to a hospital for treatment, while police
          registered a case of attempted murder.

          A bench headed by Justice BV Nagarathna, before whom the pleas were

          of India DY Chandrachud for reconstituting the original bench that
          heard the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original case was decided by Justices Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan.

          On Thursday, their counsel urged the court to list the matter on

          A 37-year-old woman is in trouble with the Delhi Police for allegedly
          deceiving a five-star hotel in Aerocity by staying in a suite for two
          weeks, faking UPI payments amounting to Rs 5-7 lakh, and attempting to

          Hotel, and the accused, hailing from Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, is
          now under police scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman arrived in Delhi alone on December 30 to celebrate New
          Year&apos;s Eve and checked into the hotel. During her stay until
          January 13, she reportedly utilized the spa and other amenities,
          incurring an additional cost of Rs 2.11 lakh. To avoid being linked to
          the charges, she allegedly used a fake name when availing these
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FIR, filed on January 13 based on the complaint of a Pullman Hotel
          staff member, reveals that the woman was evasive during police
          questioning. Initially claiming to be a lawyer, suspicions arose about
          her actual occupation, with an officer suggesting she may run a gift
          shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman purportedly attempted to feign payment for the services
          using fake UPI receipts. She showcased transactions on a bank&apos;s
          UPI mobile application, but upon verification, it was revealed that
          the bank had not received any payment. The investigation also
          disclosed that she had utilized the hotel&apos;s spa and fitness
          center under a false identity, accumulating services worth Rs 2.11
          lakh. The FIR alleges that when confronted about the fraudulent bank
          transactions, she hesitated to present the actual bank statement and
          later tried to escape with her bags from the hotel lobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon being stopped by the hotel&apos;s security staff, she reportedly
          engaged in aggressive behavior, including scratching and abusing the
          staff. The police were called, and she was taken to the IGI Airport
          police station, where she was questioned and a case of cheating was
          registered against her.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the accused has been granted bail due to the bailable nature of
          the charges, the police are now collaborating with Andhra Pradesh
          authorities to gather information about her job, profile, and any
          potential criminal history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel staff was reportedly deceived for over two weeks as the
          woman presented different UPI and bank transaction receipts, and it
          took some time for the staff to scrutinize the bills and confront her.
          The Indian Express reached out to the Pullman Hotel front desk and the
          complainant for their response, which is awaited.

          informed choice about religious identity markers. Her parents likely
          decided the hijab for her, normalizing it over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          This suggests that even if courts uphold the hijab as an exercise of
          the students&apos; right to free expression or conscience, their true
          autonomy can be questioned. The political theorist Isaiah Berlin
          differentiated between &quot;negative liberty&quot; - freedom from
          external constraints, and &quot;positive liberty&quot; - the autonomy
          to make uncoerced choices. So while courts may validate the
          students&apos; positive liberty, their negative liberty is debatable
          since coercion can take subtle forms beyond threats, like
          indoctrination. As Robert Sapolsky&apos;s recent book shows, free will
          can be distorted through various societal influences.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, many conservative Islamic schools in South India mandate
          the hijab as part of the uniform from primary to secondary levels.
          Moreover, many orthodox Muslim families make even young girls wear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problematic representations also exist, like images comparing hijabi
          and non-hijabi women to wrapped and unwrapped candies, insinuating
          only the &quot;wrapped&quot; women are protected from
          &quot;flies&quot;, i.e. harassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This indicates that the conditioning of Muslim girls into the hijab
          does occur. It raises doubts about the autonomy of students insisting
          on it inside or outside class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Significantly, the Quran does not prescribe any particular attire for
          women except modest clothing. It instructs women to &quot;lower their
          gaze&quot; - an instruction futile if in a full body veil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the word &quot;hijab&quot; occurs eight times in the Quran,
          but never denotes a headscarf. It refers to a metaphorical divide
          between people or things.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India, the hijab gained prominence mainly through the Indian
          Islamic scholar Abul Ala Maududi. His book &quot;Purdah and the Status
          of Women in Islam&quot; is widely cited by Muslim conservatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maududi insisted Muslim women cannot wear &quot;alluring&quot; clothes
          or display their beauty, but belong inside the household doing
          domestic duties. He blamed democracy and liberty for dissent against
          these views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Written in 1939, Maududi&apos;s shocking misconceptions have been
          circulating for over eighty years, spawning a paradox where free
          Muslim women use their liberty to impose patriarchal symbols in the
          name of a religion not mandating it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, while the hijab ban was discriminatory, the bigger
          issue is the insidious conditioning of girls into prioritizing
          patriarchy-sanctioned attire over education in the name of religion.
          Their autonomy is constrained by decades of misleading propaganda
          about what Islamic principles actually entail. Upholding freedom of
          religion must be accompanied by reforms to ensure genuine informed
          consent.

          A local leader of the Rajput group Karni Sena was shot dead in Uttar
          Pradesh&apos;s Badaun district late Monday night. The killing occurred
          when three brothers allegedly broke into the leader&apos;s home
          intending to abduct his 17-year-old daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Badaun police, the key perpetrator Somendra Singh, known
          as Nanhe, aged 32, was arrested Tuesday morning. A manhunt is underway
          for his two absconding brothers, Antu and Satendra, who live near the
          victim&apos;s house in Sadaullah Ganj village.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deceased, Sudhir Kumar Singh, 40, was the Badaun district vice
          president of the Karni Sena, a conservative Rajput group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sudhir&apos;s elder brother Rajiv Singh, a farmer, filed a police
          complaint stating the brothers infiltrated the house around 11pm while
          family members were in different rooms. Nanhe entered by scaling the
          wall and opened the main door to let in his brothers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They tried to forcefully take away Sudhir&apos;s daughter but her
          mother raised an alarm. Sudhir came to intervene and was overpowered
          and shot in the right thigh. Hearing gunfire, neighbors rushed over
          but the perpetrators had fled. Sudhir was taken to the district
          hospital but succumbed to excessive bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police said the accused and victim had a political rivalry. The
          accused had previously tried unsuccessfully to abduct Sudhir&apos;s
          daughter four months ago to settle scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key accused Nanhe has been jailed while efforts are ongoing to nab
          his absconding brothers. As a precaution, adequate police presence has
          been deployed in the village.
        </p>
        <p>
          The killing illustrates the law and order challenges persisting in
          parts of Uttar Pradesh. Political or personal rivalries often manifest
          in crimes like murder, abuse of women, kidnapping, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          While police claim crimes have reduced under the current government,
          opposition parties contest this. They argue high-profile crimes
          continue unabated while victims from marginalized communities fail to
          get justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Badaun murder has shades of a recent case in Lakhimpur Kheri where
          a Union Minister&apos;s son allegedly mowed down farmers protesting
          against the ruling party. Together, these incidents highlight
          lingering concerns over VIP criminality and immunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, police have acted swiftly in the Karni Sena leader&apos;s
          murder, already arresting one culprit. This sends the right signal
          that political affiliations or influence will not deter
          investigations. Extending this accountability to all cases can
          significantly improve law and order and public trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond policing, addressing the root causes behind crimes of passion
          and honor killings remains critical. Illiteracy, lack of economic
          opportunities, patriarchal mindsets, easy access to guns are all
          contributing factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state government should pursue meaningful reforms on these social
          determinants by partnering with community leaders. Eradicating VIP
          culture around crimes is one piece of restoring law and order. But
          creating an enabling social environment for vulnerable groups like
          women and lower castes is equally important. A multi-pronged strategy
          only can make Uttar Pradesh safer in the true sense.

          In Mumbai, a 19-year-old college student was attacked and seriously
          injured by a 35-year-old man she had rejected marriage proposals from
          in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident occurred on Monday afternoon near the victim Kulsum
          Shaikh&apos;s home in Goregaon East. The accused Sanjay Pralhad Bayas
          allegedly approached Shaikh from behind and slit her throat using a
          blade when she was returning from college.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bayas is a resident of the same Santosh Nagar locality as Shaikh.
          Police said he had proposed to Shaikh before, but she had turned him
          down. This led to quarrels between Bayas and the girl&apos;s family,
          although things had settled later.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Shaikh screamed for help after the throat slitting, Bayas escaped
          from the scene. Shaikh was rushed to the hospital in critical
          condition. Once she stabilized, her statement was recorded and a case
          was registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaikh sustained a deep wound requiring four stitches. Police suspect
          Bayas was intoxicated during the attack. He was arrested on Tuesday
          and charged with attempt to murder.
        </p>
        <p>
          This appears to be an instance of intimate partner violence due to
          masculine resentment against rejection. Attacking a woman for denying
          a romantic or matrimonial alliance points to a patriarchal mindset
          that women&apos;s choices should be dictated by men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extreme method of slitting the throat also indicates premeditation
          and intention to grievously hurt or kill. Shaikh is fortunate to have
          survived the assault. Considering her young age and the trauma of this
          experience, her emotional recovery may require time and counselling.
        </p>
        <p>
          While intimate partner violence often takes place within homes, this
          incident in a public space in broad daylight is alarming. It
          highlights the sense of impunity emboldening perpetrators to commit
          such crimes openly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective law enforcement can create deterrence against gender-based
          violence. Sensitizing the police to respond swiftly and sensitively to
          such complaints is vital. But preventing such violence requires
          addressing systemic social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maharashtra records among the highest cases of crimes against women
          annually. While laws and policing are tightening, mindset change
          through education and awareness is equally critical. Boys and men must
          be oriented on respecting women&apos;s consent and choices from a
          young age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rejecting a romantic interest or proposal does not imply an affront to
          male dignity. Rather, accepting a woman&apos;s decision with grace
          demonstrates strength of character. Society must reinforce such
          progressive attitudes at homes, schools and through public campaigns.

          The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued directives to authorities in
          Maharashtra&apos;s Yavatmal district and Chhattisgarh&apos;s Raipur
          district regarding upcoming rallies by a Hindu group and BJP
          legislator. The court ordered measures to prevent potential hate
          speeches during the events over the next week.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta passed
          the directives on a plea by Shaheen Abdulla alleging recurring hate
          speeches across India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plea claimed a rally by the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti in Yavatmal
          on January 18 could involve hate speech. It also cited apprehensions
          of hate speech in Raipur during rallies by BJP MLA T. Raja Singh from
          January 19-25.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bench declined to prohibit the rallies as plea respondents were
          absent. However, it directed district magistrates and police chiefs of
          both districts to install CCTV cameras at rally venues to identify
          perpetrators if hate speeches occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CCTV footage can provide evidence for action against violators.
          The court reiterated its existing guidelines against hate speech and
          said authorities must ensure compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hate speech has become a growing concern with the potential to incite
          communal unrest and violence. The court aims to deter its use and
          enable accountability through surveillance of sensitive events.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, critics argue banning speech, even offensive speech, is
          legally and ethically questionable in a democracy with freedom of
          expression. Moreover, hate speech prohibitions are sometimes misused
          to suppress dissent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the court has sought a balanced approach—allowing events subject
          to preventive monitoring. This upholds free speech while adding a
          layer of caution. Authorities can now adapt security to potential
          risks indicated by the court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much depends on strict implementation without overreach. Tolerance of
          different ideas is vital, distinguishing hate speech from legitimate
          criticism. Ultimately, no law or order solution can replace gradual
          social change towards diversity acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside deterring hate speech, active public education campaigns to
          deconstruct prejudices and promote inclusivity are essential. The
          state and civil society groups must collaborate on this grassroots
          work for sustainable communal harmony.

          The Centre has initiated the process to evict former Trinamool
          Congress MP Mahua Moitra from her government accommodation in Delhi.
          On Tuesday, the Directorate of Estates issued an eviction notice
          asking Moitra to immediately vacate the bungalow allotted to her as an
          MP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moitra was expelled from the Lok Sabha last month over allegations of
          unethical conduct. Post her expulsion, the housing allotment was
          cancelled and she was earlier asked to vacate by January 7. However,
          she had not done so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Directorate then sent notices on January 8 and 12 seeking
          explanation on why she had not vacated despite cancellation. As there
          was still no compliance, the final eviction notice was issued.
          Officials will now be deputed to ensure the bungalow is vacated
          promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously on January 4, the Delhi High Court had allowed Moitra to
          approach the Directorate requesting an extension to continue occupying
          the accommodation. The rules permit overstay of up to six months in
          exceptional circumstances on payment of charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the court did not comment on the merits of the case and left the
          decision to the Directorate&apos;s discretion. It only observed that
          due process of issuing notice before eviction must be followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moitra was expelled after being found guilty of &quot;unethical
          conduct&quot; by the ethics committee of Lok Sabha. The allegations
          were regarding accepting expensive gifts from a businessman and
          sharing her Parliament website credentials with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case highlights the strict code of conduct expected from
          lawmakers. Any breaches or ethical violations can warrant serious
          disciplinary action as was seen in Moitra&apos;s expulsion.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the former MP, loss of housing is an additional penalty alongside
          expulsion. Housing is an important perk and its withdrawal adds to the
          magnitude of her punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some argue penalizing elected representatives for misconduct
          must not extend to impacting duties towards constituents. As
          Moitra&apos;s term was cut short, continuity of her office and housing
          till next elections may have been fair.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the rules are clear that housing facilities are contingent on
          remaining an active MP. Moitra&apos;s prompt eviction sends a strong
          message that privileges come with commensurate accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The larger debate continues on strengthening parliamentary ethics and
          maintaining citizens&apos; trust. Moitra&apos;s case will serve as a
          reference on standards of probity expected from lawmakers across party
          lines.

          immediate effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development makes Sarkar the third IIM director in three years to
          not complete their tenure, preceding Uttam Kumar Sarkar and Anju Seth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This indicates the increased spotlight on abuse of power and gender
          sensitization in academic institutions, where sexual misconduct often
          gets brushed under the carpet.
        </p>
        <p>
          IIM-C&apos;s swift action shows zero tolerance for such allegations,
          especially against senior leadership. Removing the accused pending
          investigation is vital for unbiased, fair proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the rights of the accused person must also be upheld. IIM-C
          should ensure due process is followed before any conclusions are
          reached.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the case highlights the ongoing need to strengthen safeguards
          against sexual harassment and sensitize campus cultures. Educational
          institutions have a duty to lead by example in promoting gender
          justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strict policy enforcement signaled by Sarkar&apos;s removal combined
          with proactive sensitization can help India&apos;s premier institutes
          set positive precedents. The IIMs must drive change by their ethics as
          much as their academic excellence.

          US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti recently emphasized the strong
          and growing relationship between India and the United States. Speaking
          at the USC-India Innovation Summit, Garcetti described the bilateral
          ties as “multiplicative” rather than simply additive. He explained
          that when India and the US collaborate, the result is greater than the
          sum of their individual efforts and capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ambassador outlined four key pillars of the relationship between
          the two countries – peace, prosperity, planet, and people. On peace,
          he noted joint diplomacy efforts at forums like the G20. Regarding
          prosperity, he highlighted cooperation in areas like healthcare. In
          terms of planet, he mentioned aligning priorities on major global
          issues like climate change. And on the people pillar, he noted the
          deep cultural and educational ties exemplified by USC’s engagement
          with India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garcetti shared that when President Biden asked him to take on the
          ambassador role, he emphasized that India was the most important
          country in the world currently. This indicates the great significance
          the Biden administration places on strengthening ties between the two
          nations. The Ambassador said he agreed with this assessment, which is
          why he accepted the position.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the two largest democracies globally, the Ambassador said India and
          the US can demonstrate moral leadership at a crucial juncture.
          Democracies must stand together to uphold ideals like freedom, human
          rights, and the rule of law. Their partnership is not based on mere
          convenience or strategic calculations, but on shared values and a
          lasting friendship. This is embodied in institutions like USC
          fostering innovation and exchange between the two countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garcetti remarked that 2022 was an unprecedented year in US-India
          relations. He described it not just as a new peak in engagement, but a
          new foundation for the relationship. As India rapidly emerges in
          sectors from healthcare to technology to finance, the two nations now
          have an opportunity to build on this foundation for even greater
          cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ambassador expressed confidence that the best is yet to come in
          India-US relations. As the world confronts dictatorship in some
          regions, the partnership between its two largest democracies serves as
          a moral example. India and the US collaborating as equals can unlock
          solutions to pressing global challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          People-to-people ties, underpinned byIndian-Americans as a vibrant
          bridge, are bringing the two nations closer. Shared values, converging
          strategic interests, and complementary capacities provide a strong
          base. With sound diplomacy and leadership, the multiplicative India-US
          relationship can be a force for good. Both sides must continue
          nurturing it as a priority.

          contributed to the decrease, including diplomatic tensions between the

          The number of study permits issued by Canada to Indian students saw a
          sharp decline in late 2022, according to recent comments by Canadian
          Immigration Minister Marc Miller. He stated several factors
          contributed to the decrease, including diplomatic tensions between the
          two countries that led to reduced staff processing the permits in
          India. Fewer Indian students also applied due to the strained
          relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tensions stemmed from Canadian Prime Minister Justin
          Trudeau&apos;s allegation in June 2022 that there was evidence linking
          Indian agents to the murder of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh
          Nijjar in British Columbia. India rejected this claim but the damage
          was done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, India ejected a majority of Canadian diplomats working in
          the country, severely limiting Canada&apos;s capacity to process study
          permit applications. Specifically, Canada was forced to pull out 41
          diplomats, nearly two-thirds of its staff in India, after orders from
          New Delhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller stated these moves &quot;really halved our ability to process a
          lot of applications from India.&quot; Data shows Indian student
          permits dropped 86% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the
          previous quarter - from 108,940 to only 14,910.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides reduced processing capacity, some Indian students are now
          seeking options in other countries due to recent concerns over
          facilities at some Canadian institutions, according to an Indian
          official. Miller believes permit numbers are unlikely to rebound soon
          given the ongoing diplomatic tensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian students have been the largest group of international students
          in Canada in recent years, making up over 41% of all permits in 2022.
          Their enrollment brings in around $16.4 billion for Canadian
          universities annually. A decline will significantly impact revenues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller mentioned the Canadian government has also been looking to
          reduce overall international student numbers due to factors like
          housing shortages. He stated the volume of students has simply become
          &quot;out of control&quot; and needs major reduction over a short
          timeframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possible measures include a cap on numbers and changes to make
          post-graduation work permits less generous. There are also plans to
          crack down on substandard &quot;fly-by-night&quot; designated learning
          institutions that have enabled student influx.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, Canada projected roughly 900,000 international students, with
          Indians making up 40% or 360,000. Though Indian permits dropped 4%
          last year, they remained the largest group. Canada clearly relies
          heavily on Indian enrollments for its universities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ongoing diplomatic spat means this crucial source of students and
          revenue is at risk. Unless tensions ease over the disputed murder
          allegations, Indian appetite to study in Canada may wane. And reduced
          processing capacity in India will also deter students due to long wait
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canada is in a tough position balancing politics, foreign policy and
          its education sector. Allegations of Indian transnational subversion
          have clearly backfired. But both nations have a vested interest in
          restoring relations to revive educational exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller implied charges in Nijjar&apos;s case could worsen ties
          further. But conversely, if no charges materialize, diplomacy may
          gradually normalize. Canada will likely tread cautiously to avoid
          entirely alienating a key country for its international education
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interim, diversifying student source markets could hedge risks.
          But India will remain integral to Canada&apos;s universities.
          Eventually, pragmatism may override politics to reset the student
          mobility pillars of this important bilateral relationship.

          Indian-American Republican leader Nikki Haley recently rejected the
          notion that the United States has ever been a racist country. Haley,
          who came third in the recent Iowa caucuses, made these comments in an

          MSNBC host Joy Reid, who expressed doubt that Haley could win the
          Republican nomination due to the party&apos;s alleged anti-immigrant
          stance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haley suggested Reid was depicting a distorted version of America,
          very different from her own experiences. She highlighted her own
          journey as the daughter of Indian immigrants who became the first
          female minority governor of South Carolina and later UN Ambassador.
          Haley said this embodied the American dream, not racism.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked directly whether the Republican Party is racist, Haley
          firmly denied it. She stated that America overall has never been a
          racist country. While acknowledging that racism exists and she faced
          it growing up, Haley said the situation today is much better than in
          the past. The goal should be constant progress to create a more just
          society for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haley argued against dividing Americans based on race or gender. She
          expressed passion for ensuring her own children do not feel
          disadvantaged due to their ethnicity or gender. Haley wants them to
          believe that through hard work, they can achieve anything in the US.
          This requires tackling racism but not depicting America as defined by
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her third place finish in Iowa behind winner Donald Trump and
          runner-up Ron DeSantis, Haley said her campaign remains focused on the
          upcoming New Hampshire primary. She aims to maximize her performance
          there to gain momentum. Though she trails in polls, Haley represents a
          rising Indian-American voice in Republican politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some experts argue Haley’s experiences as a non-white daughter of
          immigrants clashes with trends of nativism and racism within segments
          of the Republican Party. Her denial that America is a racist country
          aims to counter this narrative. Haley contends that the American dream
          is color-blind, with equal opportunity for all who work hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, others contend Republican policies on issues from immigration
          to voting rights uphold systemic inequities. They say Haley downplays
          ongoing discrimination and barriers facing people of color. There are
          also questions whether a majority of Republican voters would back a
          non-white female nominee despite Haley’s qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an Indian-American woman, Haley’s political ascent highlights
          increasing diversity in US politics. Her competitive showing in Iowa
          despite a late entry in the primary illustrates her rising stature
          within Republican ranks. But it remains contentious whether Haley
          accurately depicts contemporary America as largely post-racial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coming primaries and election cycle will test Haley’s
          characterization of the US as a land of equal opportunity. Her vision
          contrasts with those emphasizing deep divides and discrimination still
          impacting people of color. How Haley fares with voters of diverse
          backgrounds will reveal which perspective resonates more powerfully.
          But her voice as an Indian-American adds unique texture to the
          national discourse on identity and the American ideal.

          Google recently announced that it is eliminating several hundred
          positions from its global advertising sales team. The job cuts are
          targeted at the company&apos;s &quot;large customer&quot; sales unit
          that handles major advertisers.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Google, the goal is to redirect resources to better
          support small and medium-sized businesses on its advertising
          platforms. By downsizing teams focused on large advertisers, the
          company aims to expand teams assisting smaller businesses with their
          digital advertising needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift aligns with Google&apos;s long-term growth strategy. Small
          and medium enterprises represent a massive collective opportunity
          compared to a relatively small number of large corporations. Enhancing
          services for SMBs can significantly expand Google&apos;s customer base
          over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company expects its increased investment in SMB ad sales teams
          will drive net hiring growth overall this year. The large customer job
          cuts are seen as a reallocation rather than overall downsizing of the
          sales organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google&apos;s announcement did not mention the role of new artificial
          intelligence capabilities in the changes. However, AI is transforming
          the advertising sector, enabling more automated and personalized
          services. This likely factored into Google&apos;s calculation that it
          can serve large customers equally well with fewer staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Google Cloud recently launched new AI tools to help
          retailers with tasks like automated customer service agents and
          product description generation. Generative AI can handle rote sales
          processes to free up human staff for higher-value client interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The capability of AI technologies is advancing rapidly. Google aims to
          take advantage by using them to make its operations more efficient.
          This will reduce costs and allow reallocation of resources to new
          growth areas like SMB advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          These motives likely shaped Google&apos;s decision to eliminate
          positions in the large customer ad sales team. With AI able to
          replicate lower-level sales functions, the company can focus human
          roles on small businesses that require more customized engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The changes come a year after Google laid off around 12,000 staff in
          early 2022, representing about 6% of its global workforce. That move
          aligned with cost reduction efforts in the face of high inflation and
          rising interest rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest job cuts are smaller in scale and more targeted. They
          exemplify how maturing AI capabilities are transforming businesses
          processes and workforce needs across sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This has dual implications. Firstly, automating repetitive tasks
          improves productivity and consumer experiences. But secondly,
          displacement of roles requires transition support for affected
          workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an AI leader, Google aims to harness promising new technologies.
          But it must also ensure its workforce strategies align with its brand
          values around responsible innovation. The path forward entails
          leveraging AI’s benefits while minimising its risks.

          Shortly after winning the Republican presidential primary in Iowa,
          Donald Trump appeared in a New York courtroom on Tuesday for a
          defamation trial brought by writer E. Jean Carroll. The trial centers
          around Carroll&apos;s claim that Trump sexually assaulted her in a
          department store dressing room in the 1990s, which he denied.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her opening statement, Carroll&apos;s lawyer told the jury that
          when Carroll publicly shared her account in 2019, then-President Trump
          used his powerful platform to attack her character and reputation. The
          lawyer argued Trump attempted to humiliate Carroll and destroy her
          credibility in response to her allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carroll is seeking over $10 million in damages. The jury will decide
          how much Trump should pay, not whether the alleged assault occurred or
          if he lied about it. Trump previously lost a separate defamation case
          to Carroll and is appealing the $5 million damages awarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both cases, Trump has denied knowing Carroll and claimed she
          fabricated the encounter to promote her memoir. However, the judge has
          barred him from arguing he did not defame or assault Carroll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump left the courtroom before Carroll&apos;s lawyer gave opening
          remarks. His attendance demonstrates the legal jeopardy he still faces
          despite leaving office. The trial commences after Trump secured his
          first primary victory in the 2024 Republican nomination race in Iowa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The defamation proceedings will likely revive discussion of the
          decades-old assault allegations against Trump at a sensitive time in
          his political comeback bid. Trump&apos;s credibility among voters and
          ongoing legal issues could emerge as liabilities during the campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Carroll sees the trial as a chance for justice and
          accountability. Though the alleged assault occurred years ago, she
          aims to use the civil lawsuit to send a message about confronting
          abuse of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case highlights how private figures like Carroll can face
          difficulties getting legal recourse over harassment claims against
          influential public figures. Defamation suits allow alternative avenues
          to dispute denials and mitigate damages to reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, critics argue such cases set risky precedents infringing on
          free speech rights. There are also concerns over using courts as
          forums to litigate alleged sexual misconduct lacking sufficient
          evidence. The Carroll lawsuit encapsulates the complex dynamics around
          high-profile #MeToo cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the jury will have to weigh both sides’ arguments in
          deciding damages. But the verdict’s wider symbolic impact could
          transcend financial awards. For Carroll, it’s become about restoring
          her credibility and challenging impunity. For Trump, it threatens to
          further tarnish his image during his election rerun.

          the Geeta Colony Flyover.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a Delhi Police official, preliminary findings suggest
          that the accident occurred due to poor visibility on the road, and
          they were notified about the incident at 1:30 am.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collision occurred on Salim Garg Road near Jheel Cut, just before
          the Geeta Colony Flyover in the Kotwali area, as reported by Manoj
          Kumar Meena, DCP (North). At the scene, both vehicles, a Celerio and a
          Swift, both displaying license plates, were found significantly
          damaged.

          Upon initial investigation, it was revealed that the Celerio was
          struck by the Swift from the opposite carriageway, causing substantial
          damage to the central road divider. The driver of the Swift,
          identified as Gaurav Malhotra from Laxmi Nagar, lost his life in the
          collision.
        </p>
        <p>
          DCP Meena further stated, &quot;Four other individuals, namely Sumi,
          Saurav, and two unidentified persons, sustained injuries. One of them
          is in critical condition and has been admitted to the Trauma Centre. A
          case has been registered against unknown persons under the sections of
          causing death due to negligence and rash driving of the IPC (Indian
          Penal Code).&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic incident highlights the dangerous consequences of the
          collision, with one fatality and multiple individuals grappling with
          injuries. The authorities are actively investigating the case,
          focusing on potential negligence and reckless driving as contributing
          factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This unfortunate event serves as a somber reminder of the importance
          of road safety and the need for heightened awareness, especially
          during periods of low visibility. As the investigation unfolds,
          authorities will likely seek to determine the exact circumstances
          leading to the collision and hold those responsible accountable for
          the tragic outcome.

          The film, produced and distributed by Sony Pictures Films India
          Private Limited, featuring Mrunal Thakur, Abhimanyu Dassai, and Paresh
          Rawal, was released in November of the preceding year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dehadrai argued that the entire film contained highly offensive
          references, describing it as a comedy with an exceptionally
          distasteful portrayal of individuals with permanent disabilities. He
          emphasized that the film perpetuated negative stereotypes, deviating
          from its intended comedic nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these claims, the Delhi High Court declined to entertain the
          plea. The court&apos;s decision signifies a legal stance against the
          petitioner&apos;s argument that the film violated the rights of
          individuals with disabilities, as outlined in the RPwD Act. The
          court&apos;s rejection implies that, based on their evaluation, the
          film does not appear to infringe upon the legal provisions intended to
          protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This legal development highlights the challenges in navigating the
          intersection of artistic expression and potential societal impact,
          especially when it comes to sensitive subjects like disabilities.
          While the petitioner raised concerns about offensive portrayals and
          perpetuation of negative stereotypes in the film, the court&apos;s
          decision signals a subjective interpretation of the content within the
          framework of existing laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          As debates around creative freedom and responsible representation in
          the entertainment industry continue, legal cases like these underscore
          the importance of finding a balance between artistic expression and
          ensuring that content does not compromise the dignity and rights of
          specific communities. The court&apos;s decision serves as a precedent
          in addressing such concerns within the evolving landscape of media and
          entertainment law.

          In anticipation of unemployment emerging as a pivotal issue in the
          upcoming 2024 elections, the Sangh Parivar is actively steering the
          narrative away from mere job seeking. Over the past two years, a
          concerted effort has been made to emphasize self-employment and guide
          young individuals in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In sync with the government&apos;s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the
          Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) launched its Swavalambi Bharat
          Abhiyan on January 12, 2022. This initiative, led by the economic wing
          of the RSS, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), aims to inspire youth to
          become entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last two years, the SJM and affiliated organizations within
          the RSS have organized 4,413 programs across 511 districts, involving
          over 82,000 youths, collaborating with 400 industrial units, and
          honoring 3,938 entrepreneurs. Additionally, 448 Zilla Rozgar Kendras
          (district employment centers) have been established to assist young
          entrepreneurs in securing funds, arranging necessary training,
          providing legal guidance, and facilitating government clearances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ashwani Mahajan, the national co-convenor of SJM, underscores the need
          to shift the mindset from job-seeking, attributing the inclination
          towards government jobs to policies initiated by Jawaharlal Nehru.
          Mahajan contends that with millions entering the job market annually,
          neither the government nor multinational corporations can provide
          employment opportunities for everyone. The solution, according to him,
          lies in fostering entrepreneurship and revitalizing India&apos;s
          historical legacy as a land of entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of their strategy, the SJM has conducted Entrepreneur
          Development Programs in 2,701 high schools and intermediate colleges,
          1,555 institutions and colleges, and 155 universities. The focus is on
          nurturing the risk-taking ability of young individuals by sharing
          success stories of fellow entrepreneurs and facilitating fund-raising
          through various channels such as private equity funds, government bank
          loans, and Mudra loans. The SJM aims to create an ecosystem that
          sustains entrepreneurial growth with collaboration from diverse
          sections, including politicians and corporates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous organizations affiliated with the Sangh Parivar, such as the
          Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Laghu Udyog Bharti,
          and others, are actively involved in this endeavor. External
          contributors include Zoho Corporation, Gayatri Parivar, Kaneri Math,
          and several more, showcasing a wide-ranging collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahajan highlights the establishment of numerous entrepreneurial
          ventures, including tailoring centers, beauty parlors, computer
          centers, Krishi Vikas Kendras, and Farmer Producer Organizations
          (FPOs) across the country over the past two years. To complement these
          efforts, the SJM has published multiple books on the theme of
          self-employment and even released a song titled &quot;Hum sabko aage
          badhna hai&quot; (We all have to advance), sung by playback artist
          Kailash Kher. The multifaceted approach aims to foster a culture of
          entrepreneurship and address the challenges posed by unemployment.

          In Karnataka&apos;s Haveri district, two men affiliated with a group
          accused of assaulting a Muslim woman and a Hindu man on January 8 are
          facing fresh charges in an assault case involving a 19-year-old woman
          in the same area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 19-year-old Muslim woman experienced an assault by these men,
          accompanied by three others, in the first week of January. The
          incident came to light after police discovered videos of the attack.
          In the January 8 incident at a hotel in Hanagal, the accused recorded
          a video of their assault on the interfaith couple, circulating it on
          social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yallappa Hiraganavar, an officer from the Hanagal police station,
          filed a complaint against Aftab Maqbool Ahmed, a 24-year-old mechanic,
          and Mardansab Mohammed Isaq Mandakki, a 23-year-old merchant, along
          with three others—Mehaboob Ali Gaffarsab Savikeri, Sahib Channapur,
          and Tanveer Gouda, all residents of Hanagal—for attacking the
          19-year-old woman. Ahmed and Mandakki are already in police custody
          over the January 8 attack and the alleged gangrape of a 26-year-old
          married Muslim woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a new police complaint registered on January 14 at the
          Hanagal police station, the 19-year-old woman was allegedly abducted
          by the gang on January 4 between 12 noon and 3 pm after she got off a
          bus. The gang purportedly outraged the modesty of the young woman and
          threatened her with dire consequences if she spoke out about the
          attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the complaint, the gang is said to have interrogated her about a
          man she was traveling with on the bus and whether she had willingly
          gone with him. They recorded a video of the moral policing incident
          and shared it on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, between January 10 and 14, Haveri police arrested seven men
          in connection with the January 8 assault case. Anshu Kumar,
          Superintendent of Police, Haveri, confirmed these arrests during a
          press briefing on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial FIR in the case was filed on January 10 by the Hanagal
          police, prompted by a room boy at the Idigas Lodge. The interfaith
          couple had refrained from filing a complaint due to fears of
          repercussions from their spouses.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, during a court appearance, the woman stated that she was also
          raped by the gang, who took her away after storming into their hotel
          room. The police subsequently invoked charges of gang rape against the
          accused based on the woman’s allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the seven men arrested for the January 8 incident is an
          autorickshaw driver named Abdul Khadar Jaffarsab, 28, who reportedly
          served as an informant to the gang about the interfaith couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police are investigating if some of the accused are involved in
          additional attacks on women under the guise of moral policing in the
          region. The accused have allegedly recorded videos of their assaults
          and shared them on social media, prompting the police to suspect that
          they may have been engaged in such crimes in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          These moral policing incidents, typically associated with right-wing
          groups in coastal Karnataka, have taken a political turn in Haveri.
          BJP leaders have criticized the ruling Congress government, with
          former chief minister and senior BJP leader Basavaraj Bommai, who
          hails from Haveri, alleging double standards in the state
          government&apos;s approach to tackling moral policing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bommai has demanded the creation of a Special Investigation Team to
          look into these cases and has accused the police of attempting to
          downplay the case by taking down a statement that did not include
          gangrape allegations. The situation raises concerns about the
          prevalence of moral policing, the safety of individuals in the region,
          and the effectiveness of the current legal system in ensuring justice
          for survivors. The involvement of political figures and potential
          manipulation of the legal process further underscore the need for a
          comprehensive examination of the root causes and factors contributing
          to such crimes.

          controversial remarks made in Kumta during a speech on January 13th
          about the Ram Mandir consecration event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suo motu case against the MP was filed by a police sub-inspector
          attached to the Kumta police station. The complaint alleges Hegde was
          recorded on video making provocative statements against other
          religious groups in a speech to BJP workers and supporters on January
          13th.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his address, the far-right MP called for demolishing several
          mosques in Karnataka, similar to Babri Masjid, claiming they were
          constructed over Hindu temples. The BJP had distanced itself from
          Hegde&apos;s comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Some people can take it as a threat also. We will definitely do
          it. This is a decision of the Hindu community, not of Anantkumar
          Hegde,&quot; he stated at the Kumta meeting on Saturday. &quot;...in
          every village of the state there are small religious places which were
          violated. Until they are demolished, the Hindu community will not sit
          idle....,&quot; he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Revenge, revenge, revenge. If we do not take revenge for 1,000
          years, then the Hindu community can clearly say that this is not Hindu
          blood. We are not a community which will be in debt. We will clear the
          debt at any cost,&quot; Hegde emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police complaint registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections
          153, 153A and 505 quotes Hegde&apos;s statements verbatim for making
          inflammatory remarks and fomenting enmity between groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          A five-time BJP MP, Anantkumar Hegde is a prospective BJP Lok Sabha
          candidate from Uttara Kannada for the upcoming elections. He had been
          inactive in public life the past couple of years owing to illness. In
          the past few weeks, Hegde resumed meeting people to secure candidature
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the first time Hegde has stirred controversy with his
          hardline remarks. In 2017, as a Union Minister, he sparked outrage by
          terming secularists as &quot;people without parentage&quot;.
          Previously in 2016, he had equated Islam with terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest case underscores tensions between Hindu nationalist
          politicians and minority groups in Karnataka. It evokes memories of
          the contentious Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 by Hindu nationalist
          mobs who claimed the 16th century mosque was built over a temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          By calling for similar demolitions, Hegde&apos;s rhetoric threatens to
          inflame communal tensions in the state along religious lines. It also
          contradicts the BJP&apos;s official stance of distancing itself from
          his comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Hegde retains significant support among hardcore Hindu
          nationalists and right-wing voters. Despite past controversies, he was
          appointed a central minister and may be renominated for the Lok Sabha
          polls. This highlights the sway of extremist politicians within the
          party.
        </p>
        <p>
          But such figures also damage the BJP&apos;s image among moderate
          voters and minorities. With Karnataka being a communally sensitive
          state, Hegde&apos;s fiery rhetoric has the potential to stir social
          disharmony during election season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police case indicates authorities are taking his remarks seriously
          given their provocative nature. But it remains to be seen whether
          Hegde will face any meaningful censure from within his party or
          criminal charges for his latest outburst.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fate will be an important test of how far the BJP is willing to go
          to contain fringe extremist voices while still harnessing their
          support during elections. It will also determine whether the party
          prizes broader social harmony over consolidating a hardline
          majoritarian voter base.

          As the prolonged winter break ends, schools in Delhi are set to resume

          preemptive measure considering the ongoing cold wave conditions and
          foggy weather, school timings have been modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a directive issued by the Education Department on Sunday,
          no schools will commence sessions before 9 AM or continue beyond 5 PM
          until further notice. This adjusted schedule applies to all students
          in government, government-aided, and recognized private schools,
          including those in nursery, kindergarten, and primary sections. The
          order stated that the standard reporting time remains unchanged for
          all teaching and non-teaching faculty.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With the aim of exercising caution given the current foggy
          circumstances, no school (including those with double shifts) will
          begin before 9 AM or have classes after 5 PM until additional
          guidelines are provided,&quot; the order outlined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, on January 7th, Delhi&apos;s Education Minister Atishi
          announced that the winter break would be prolonged until January 12th
          for students from nursery to 5th standard, in light of the severe cold
          wave conditions in the national capital. &quot;Schools in Delhi will
          stay closed for the next 5 days owing to the ongoing cold weather, for
          students from nursery to class 5,&quot; Atishi had tweeted at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Delhi recorded its lowest temperature this winter season so
          far, with the mercury plummeting to 3.5 degrees Celsius. The cold
          intensified further in the Lodhi Road area, where the minimum
          temperature fell to 3.4 degrees Celsius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most parts of Delhi-NCR were enveloped in dense fog, bringing
          visibility on roads down to zero.

          The ongoing tensions in the Red Sea resulting from repeated assaults
          on commercial vessels by Yemen’s Houthi rebels are negatively
          impacting the global supply chain. This could lead to a $10-20
          increase in oil prices for major oil importing countries such as
          India, according to World Economic Forum (WEF) President Borge Brende.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an exclusive interview with India Today TV/Business Today and News
          Director Rahul Kanwal, Brende stated that closing the Suez Canal would
          be detrimental for the global supply chain. He expressed hope that the
          Houthi attacks in the region would cease soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brende made these remarks just as the 54th annual World Economic Forum
          meeting is set to commence in the scenic city of Davos, Switzerland.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the interview, Brende highlighted that trade growth fell to
          0.8% last year compared to 3.4%. However, he remained optimistic that
          global trade will “pick up a bit” this year, despite the Red Sea
          crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;However, it doesn’t take much to also have a negative impact on
          this if we close the Red Sea. Even closing the Suez Canal for weeks
          will have a very negative impact on the global supply chain. So, a lot
          is at stake. We also know that this has an impact on oil prices and
          for major oil-importing countries like India, where a $10-20 increase
          in oil prices will have very negative effects on the economy,&quot; he
          explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;So, I hope that this will not escalate further and that shipping
          can resume as usual in the Red Sea in a few days,&quot; he added.

            <p>
              Brende was optimistic regarding the Indian economy, projecting 8%
              growth this year. &quot;We think, in the coming decade, we can be
              speaking about a $10 trillion economy, at least in the coming two
              decades,&quot; he stated.
            </p>
            <p>
              He praised India&apos;s growth narrative, noting that the country
              was developing its digital economy twice as fast as the rest of
              the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;India has been at the forefront due to the digital economy
              and the export of services. This is a very sweet spot for India.
              But, of course, reforms should continue in India. Reforms related
              to education, funding and reforms to tackle unnecessary red tape
              should continue. I feel there is an understanding of all these
              things in New Delhi,&quot; Brende remarked.

              Acknowledging India&apos;s increasing global prominence, Brende
              cited an example where there was a &quot;long waiting list&quot;
              of Indian officials waiting to meet him in a room that could only
              accommodate &quot;100 people&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;We have a lot of Indian companies here. India is growing
              very fast. There&apos;s a lot of interest in India. There is a
              country strategy meeting on India where the three ministers that
              are here will conduct, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
              Governor is here too. I was told by my team that it was
              oversubscribed after half an hour. So, there&apos;s a long waiting
              list,&quot; he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;I think we can only fit 100 of them in the room. They are
              still waiting and they can&apos;t get in and they are upset. So, I
              said, maybe we will have to look for a bigger room,&quot; he
              chuckled.

            <p>
              Discussing global economic growth, Brende stated that the WEF
              projected 2.9% growth this year but was hopeful it could surpass
              3% soon. &quot;We should also acknowledge that many economists
              expected a recession in the US, the largest economy constituting
              25% of global GDP. But there is no recession. It&apos;s probably a
              soft landing. We&apos;re seeing inflation abating a bit. Interest
              rates will then go down,&quot; he explained.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;For India, I think if trade grows again and India gets a
              little more tailwind from the global economy in 2025, I think, as
              I said earlier, India could be a $10 trillion economy in the
              medium to long term, provided reforms continue,&quot; he added.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Brende, the upcoming elections in India, the US, the
              UK, Russia and the European Parliament will have a “huge impact”
              on the global economic outlook this &quot;election year&quot;.

              collaboration due to a “clear trust deficit”.

            <p>
              &quot;There is also huge geopolitical competition. But even in a

          The widely shared footage has provoked numerous reactions from social

          pointed to the frustration among travelers given IndiGo&apos;s pileup
          of complaints over cancellations, unreasonable delays, and subpar
          service standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video shows the captain making a statement about delays. Suddenly,
          a passenger wearing a yellow hoodie rushes up and slaps the captain
          across the face. A flight attendant standing next to the captain
          immediately intervenes, shielding the captain and trying to defuse the
          situation. The attacker is then pulled back by another man in a sky
          blue hoodie as commotion spreads in the cabin.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Sir, you cannot do this,&quot; the flight attendant is heard
          saying as she protects the captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many passengers can be heard justifying the passenger&apos;s behavior,
          blaming IndiGo for the delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The captain had announced the delays after replacing the previous crew
          owing to Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations following
          several hours of waiting. The viral video stated the flight was
          &quot;13 hours&quot; delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FDTL rules mandate adequate rest periods for pilots and crew to
          reduce fatigue, established by the Directorate General of Civil
          Aviation (DGCA).
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes amid a barrage of complaints against IndiGo on social
          media, with numerous accounts of delays and chaos. On Saturday, actor
          Radhika Apte shared her terrible experience after being confined on an
          aerobridge at Mumbai airport for hours along with fellow travelers.
          She said IndiGo staff were clueless, depriving passengers including
          seniors and infants of food and restroom breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flight operations have been hampered the past few days due to harsh

          Pakistan&apos;s designs to revive terrorism in the region,
          particularly in Rajouri and Poonch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are intended to be similar to Operation Sarpvinash in
          2003 which targeted terrorists in the same area south of the Pir
          Panjals. The Army Chief General Manoj Pande recently stated that
          terrorist activities had almost vanished there since 2003, but
          Pakistan is now trying to revive terrorism in the region again. He and
          the Northern Army Command held detailed discussions on ways to counter
          this new terrorist threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are being closely monitored by Army Headquarters and
          the Northern Command in Udhampur and were planned soon after Home
          Minister Amit Shah held a high-level security meeting with National
          Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the Army, intelligence agencies, and
          police officials. The Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi
          has also held coordination meetings for joint action against
          terrorists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian Army has started inducting more troops into Rajouri and
          Poonch and strengthening intelligence capabilities. The security
          forces are confident of local support to counter terrorism in the
          area. Even when terrorists provoked troops to fire on civilians at
          Krisna Ghati, the forces showed restraint knowing it could turn the
          population against them. Swift action against own officers and men
          involved in civilian deaths post the December 21 encounter has also
          helped maintain local goodwill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are intended to deny any space for terrorism to revive
          in the region. In the last two decades, determined counterterrorism
          efforts have ensured a marked reduction in violence. However, Pakistan
          has continued to support cross-border terrorism to destabilize Jammu
          and Kashmir. Groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed have
          training camps across the border. Terrorists are regularly sent across
          the Line of Control under cover fire from Pakistan Army posts. Local
          youth are radicalized and recruited too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The increase in infiltration attempts over the last year, arms and
          ammunition drops by drones, and recruitments indicate Pakistan&apos;s
          desperation to stoke terrorism especially after the removal of Jammu
          and Kashmir&apos;s special status. Islamabad wants to portray that the
          situation is not normalizing even three years after Article 370 was
          nullified. Also, fomenting trouble in border areas pins down Indian
          forces. With India-Pakistan tensions at a high after recent terrorist
          incidents, Pakistan would want to keep the border hot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its efforts to revive terrorism south of Pir Panjals poses a double
          threat as it provides entry into both Jammu and Kashmir regions.
          Rajouri and Poonch are very close to the strategic Jammu-Srinagar
          National Highway that is the lifeline of the Kashmir valley. Any major
          attack here can have psychological and economic impact far beyond the
          local populace and suits Pakistan&apos;s disruptive agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why the Indian Army is launching coordinated counterterrorism
          operations across the Pir Panjals before terrorism takes root again.
          The aim is to completely eliminate terrorist presence in these areas.
          In 2003 too, relentless operations had broken the back of terrorism
          here. Though eliminating every terrorist is difficult given the
          terrain and porous border, the intent is to inflict unacceptable
          losses through unrelenting pressure. The counter-infiltration grid
          along the Line of Control is also being strengthened to prevent entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the operations to succeed, gaining the confidence of the local
          population is vital. Sympathetic locals provide information, logistics
          and recruits to sustain terrorism. Alienating civilians can undermine
          even the best-planned operations. The Indian Army has reached out to
          the people through meetings, campaigns and civic action programs.
          Steps have been taken to minimize inconvenience and safeguard human
          rights during operations. Conduct of units is being closely monitored
          to avoid collateral damage. Any excesses are promptly investigated and
          punished as seen in the recent action against erring personnel. These
          measures are helping foster goodwill and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operation Sarvashakti has commenced in early 2022 at a time when heavy
          snow limits infiltrations. Come summer, as passes open, more
          terrorists will try to infiltrate. The Indian Army aims to use this
          winter to hit terror groups hard before the summer infiltration
          season. With meticulous preparation, transparency, sensitivity and
          determined execution, these operations can deal a decisive blow. The
          Indian Army remains steadfast in its commitment to break the back of
          Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and usher in an era of peace and
          stability for the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <p>
          President Joe Biden revealed that the United States had privately
          conveyed a message to Iran regarding the Iran-backed Houthi rebels
          carrying out attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea.
          &quot;We delivered it privately and we&apos;re confident we&apos;re
          well-prepared,&quot; Biden told reporters at the White House before
          leaving for Camp David for the weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disclosure comes after the Houthi movement threatened a
          &quot;strong and effective response&quot; following an overnight U.S.
          military strike in Yemen, further increasing tensions as Washington
          vows to protect shipping from assaults by the Iran-aligned group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest U.S. strike, which the Pentagon said targeted Houthi radar
          facilities, occurred a day after dozens of American and British
          strikes on other Houthi sites in Yemen. According to White House
          spokesperson John Kirby, the initial strikes degraded the
          Houthis&apos; capability to store, launch and guide missiles or drones
          which they have frequently used to threaten shipping lanes. Kirby
          emphasized that Washington had no interest in waging war in Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked by journalists whether he now felt the term
          &quot;terrorist&quot; was applicable to the Houthi rebels, Biden
          replied &quot;I think they are.&quot; This comes after the Biden
          administration controversially revoked the State Department&apos;s
          designation of the Houthis as a &quot;foreign terrorist
          organization&quot; in 2021, part of a policy shift aiming to ease
          humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. message to Iran highlights Washington&apos;s belief that
          Tehran bears responsibility for the Houthis&apos; aggressive actions
          as their chief international sponsor and arms supplier. While both
          Iran and the Houthis deny any formal relationship, UN experts have
          found extensive evidence of Iranian weapons transfers and other
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proxy groups like the Houthis give Iran strategic leverage in the
          region while allowing it to maintain deniability for their actions.
          U.S. officials hope conveying their awareness of Iranian ties may
          induce Tehran to reign in the Houthis before the situation escalates
          further.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, experts warn the private U.S. message is unlikely to persuade
          Iran to pull back support and curb Houthi attacks on shipping in the
          Red Sea, a crucial commercial waterway. The Houthis have become
          increasingly brazen, using drones and missiles to target vessels
          sailing to and from the Suez Canal. Millions of barrels of oil pass
          through the area daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Houthis say they are retaliating for coalition airstrikes
          and a sea blockade, their attacks are seen as part of a broader
          Iranian strategy to project power and demonstrate the vulnerability of
          global energy supply chains. Disrupting shipping could also drive up
          oil prices which benefits Tehran.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. is coordinating closely with Gulf allies like Saudi Arabia
          and the UAE who are battling the Houthis in Yemen. But American
          officials are wary of being dragged into Yemen&apos;s complex civil
          war. The limited strikes specifically targeted Houthi capabilities to
          threaten shipping and avoid civilian areas. But analysts caution that
          direct U.S. intervention could empower the Houthis and aid their
          recruitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          With no clear military solution in Yemen, experts argue the only way
          forward is a negotiated settlement between the Houthis and
          Saudi-backed Yemeni government. But meaningful talks have stalled
          despite international efforts. The Houthis may prefer to keep fighting
          amid perceived battlefield gains while the Saudis remain skeptical of
          their intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, the uptick in Houthi attacks has turned the Red Sea
          into an arena for shadowy attacks and counterstrikes. The U.S. message
          to Iran reflects the seriousness with which it views the threat to
          international shipping. While seeking to avoid further escalation,
          Washington also wants to signal its resolve to protect freedom of
          navigation and safeguard a vital global trade artery.

          Amid rising unemployment and a housing crisis in Canada, Immigration
          Minister Marc Miller announced that in the coming months he will
          examine capping the number of international students residing in the
          country. Miller did not specify the extent of the reduction being
          considered in the immigration system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview with Vassy Kapelos on CTV&apos;s Question Period,
          Miller stated a federal-provincial discussion is needed &quot;to
          ensure provinces not doing their jobs actually rein in student numbers
          purely on a volume basis.&quot; He said the volume of international
          students in Canada is &quot;disconcerting&quot; and the system has
          &quot;gotten out of control.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller plans to explore setting a cap on international students in the
          first half of 2023 to help ease housing demand. When asked why the
          government is only now considering a cap despite the idea being raised
          months ago, he said federal level data is needed first before
          examining each province&apos;s institutions that may be profiting from
          high enrollment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It&apos;s time to have a conversation about volumes and the
          impact that is having in certain areas,&quot; Miller added. A student
          cap would not be a one-size-fits-all solution for housing shortages
          nationwide, he noted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller also said housing is only one factor in immigration targets.
          The pressing need to lower the workforce&apos;s average age must also
          be considered. While not providing specifics, he said reducing student
          numbers through a cap is under consideration and will remain so. Out
          of courtesy to the provinces, these discussions will occur at the
          negotiating table first, Miller stated, also factoring in
          institutions&apos; financial needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government has faced criticism for accepting rising immigrants,
          both permanent and temporary, amid a housing crisis. Internal
          documents show public servants warned two years ago that high
          immigration goals could threaten affordability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Liberals aim to welcome 485,000 immigrants this year, and 500,000
          in 2025 and 2026. Hundreds of thousands of temporary residents like
          international students and migrant workers also arrive annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          A student cap would aim to curb demand, but risks detrimental impacts
          on institutions reliant on their tuition. Canada is a top global study
          destination and international students provide economic benefits. A
          balanced approach is needed to manage volumes without disrupting
          education and migration systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provinces like Ontario which attract nearly 40% of Canada&apos;s
          international students could be disproportionately affected by a
          blanket cap. A tailored province-wise approach may be more prudent.
          Students also create jobs and growth, so local labor market needs must
          be analyzed before reducing numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capping student visas also does not address the root cause of housing
          unaffordability - insufficient supply. A cap could even worsen
          shortages if students continue arriving while fewer homes get built.
          Alongside any immigration changes, experts stress boosting housing
          supply by updating zoning laws and slashing red tape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stakeholder views are important too before enacting a cap.
          Institutions warn blunt cuts could cripple revenue and impact
          learning. Students fear upending their future plans. A nuanced
          solution like needs-based entry could be explored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatives like rent controls, vacant home taxes and boosting
          on-campus housing should be considered as well. A student cap risks
          damaging Canada’s reputation as a welcoming study destination.
          Partnerships with universities to align enrollment and housing
          capacity better could be fruitful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, a balanced approach is required that stabilizes
          immigration at sustainable levels while rapidly expanding housing
          supply, especially affordable units. Canada’s future growth and
          competitiveness hinges on getting this policy mix right. A student cap
          may be one temporary tool, but broader structural solutions around
          housing and immigration are imperative for lasting impact.

          Ramdev has reiterated that he did not intend to degrade any community.
          His statement was in response to Owaisi&apos;s remark insinuating
          Ramdev&apos;s non-Brahmin origins. Ramdev maintains he was simply

          Premji had hired him, things may have transpired differently for both
          him and Wipro.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1981, Murthy founded Infosys along with six friends and 10,000
          rupees of seed capital provided by his wife and author Sudha Murty.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Murthy built Infosys from the ground up, Premji transformed his
          family&apos;s vegetable oil business into a global IT solutions
          provider. As of January 2024, Infosys is valued at 6.65 lakh crore
          rupees while Wipro stands at 2.43 lakh crore, exemplifying the
          divergent fortunes of the two IT titans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy&apos;s entrepreneurial journey began with a research job at IIM
          Ahmedabad followed by a stint as chief systems programmer developing
          India&apos;s first BASIC interpreter for an early computer. After a
          failed prior tech venture called Softronics, the seeds of Infosys were
          sown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy&apos;s perspective on family businesses differs markedly from
          Premji&apos;s approach. While Premji&apos;s son Rishad took over the
          reins at Wipro in 2019, Murthy asserts his son Rohan would never ask
          to be part of Infosys. &quot;I think he&apos;s even stricter than me
          on these ideas; he will never say that,&quot; Murthy stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decades ago, Murthy similarly rejected his wife Sudha Murty&apos;s
          wish to join Infosys, a decision he now regrets. Murthy admitted he
          was wrongly idealistic in not supporting Sudha, an engineer he says
          was more qualified than Infosys&apos; founders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy has espoused keeping family and business separate, wanting
          Infosys to be a meritocratic workplace not influenced by nepotism. He
          credits Infosys&apos; success to its world-class governance and
          management entirely unrelated to the founders&apos; families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infosys&apos; credo of empowering professionals on merit dissuaded
          Murthy&apos;s children from seeing Infosys as their entitlement.
          Murthy takes pride that his daughter is a schoolteacher and son is an
          academic uninterested in Infosys. He believes family businesses often
          struggle when incompetent heirs ascend due to privilege rather than
          capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Premji&apos;s grooming of Rishad since 2007 to lead Wipro evokes the
          old-world family business model where bloodline trumps merit.
          Murthy&apos;s point is underscored by the middling performance of many
          Indian family conglomerates. Infosys&apos; rise as a global success
          story built on transparent governance and talent shows an alternative
          path.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Premji&apos;s well-planned generational transition has so far
          been smooth. Rishad&apos;s track record includes leading Wipro&apos;s
          strategy and M&A for years before assuming the CEO role. Good
          succession planning has allowed the $11 billion company to continue
          its growth trajectory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts say neither approach is necessarily right or wrong. Premji has
          ensured continuity and stability by elevating his son. Murthy has
          upheld fairness and achievement by excluding his children. There are
          merits and demerits to both philosophies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, what matters is identifying and empowering the right
          leaders to take an organization forward. Wipro and Infosys exemplify
          how different leadership models can thrive. Their unique approaches
          shaped by the personal values of their pioneering founders offer
          important lessons for Indian business.

        <p>
          Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, is poised for an elevation
          within the royal family to a pivotal role in King Charles III’s
          restructured monarchy. According to reports, the mother of three could
          be granted new powers by the King after celebrating her 42nd birthday
          recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mail reported that Kate will mark her birthday privately in
          Windsor with husband Prince William and their children George,
          Charlotte and Louis, before returning to school. But soon, she is
          expected to be promoted as per a source.
        </p>
        <p>
          King Charles is said to be considering appointing Kate as a Royal Lady
          of the Order of the Garter. This is regarded as Britain&apos;s most
          senior chivalric order, with members personally chosen by the monarch.
          Prince William, Camilla, Princess Anne and Prince Edward already
          belong to the Order of the Garter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If inducted, Kate would gain the authority to grant royal warrants,
          similar to Camilla and William. Granting royal warrants allows firms
          to use the Royal Arms in branding and supply the royal household. This
          power was previously held by King Charles as Prince of Wales,
          bequeathed by the late Queen Elizabeth II.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Charles retains the power for now, he may eventually grant it to
          Camilla and William too. But some royal warrant holders believe Kate
          officially endorsing brands would provide a huge boost to British
          industry, driving fashion and lifestyle interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a working member of the royal family, Kate has grown into her roles
          over the years. She has focused on early childhood development,
          promoting sports and outdoor activities. Along with William, Kate has
          also advocated for mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, she played piano publically for the first time during a
          Christmas carol concert. Kate has also emphasized environmental
          awareness and sustainability through her initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per reports, King Charles aims to reduce costs and streamline the
          monarchy to core members carrying out official duties. These include
          Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, Princess Anne and Prince Edward
          and his wife Sophie.
        </p>
        <p>
          The promotion indicates Kate’s ever-important position in the new
          royal order. It reflects the faith Charles has in the Princess to take
          on more responsibility as a senior royal.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 41, Kate is the youngest Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter
          after Queen Mary in the early 1900s. Her induction will make her the
          only woman apart from Camilla in the order. It highlights her
          significance and the prominence of her role alongside William.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles is expected to undertake the Order of the Garter appointments
          in June 2023. The ceremony takes place annually at St. George’s Chapel
          in Windsor. The order consists of the monarch, prince consort, and 24
          knights chosen personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in 1348 by King Edward III, it recognizes high achievement and
          public service. The knights wear elaborate blue velvet robes and
          plumed hats for ceremonies. New knights take part in an investiture
          and pageantry-filled service presided by the King.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Kate, being granted powers to endorse royal warrants shortly after
          turning 40 reinforces her image as a dependable future queen consort.
          It reflects the royal family&apos;s confidence in her maturity and
          readiness for more responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          From being a commoner to future Queen, Kate has come a long way. Her
          evolution into a senior working royal will only accelerate after this
          promotion. With King Charles intent on a meritocratic monarchy, Kate
          and Prince William will have to continually prove their mettle as the
          new face of the modern royal family.

          Tensions have escalated along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border after
          Pakistan began demanding passports and visas from Afghan truck drivers
          at the key Torkham crossing on Saturday. For years, truckers have been
          able to cross freely without documents. But the new requirements have
          effectively closed the vital trade route.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noor Mohammad Hanif, an official in Afghanistan&apos;s Nangarhar
          province, said Pakistani officials suddenly started asking Afghan
          drivers for passports and visas at Torkham. Since most drivers do not
          possess these documents, traffic has stalled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In retaliation, Afghanistan has also started demanding the same from
          Pakistani truckers, according to a statement from the Nangarhar
          governor&apos;s office. Officials from both sides are holding
          discussions to resolve the impasse, with a decision expected soon, the
          statement added.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Torkham crossing has experienced closures multiple times in recent
          months, including a nine-day shutdown in September due to border
          forces clashing. On Saturday, dozens of trucks carrying perishable
          items like vegetables and fruits remained stuck on both sides, unable
          to cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysts see this as part of the lingering tensions between Pakistan
          and Afghanistan&apos;s Taliban government. Pakistan is worried about
          the Pakistani Taliban finding sanctuary and regrouping in Afghanistan
          after the Taliban takeover. It has blamed the group for increased
          militant attacks against Pakistani security forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Afghan Taliban denies allowing Pakistani Taliban fighters
          to use its soil for attacks in Pakistan. Last week, senior Pakistani
          politician Fazlur Rehman visited Kabul, the first high-level visit
          since the Taliban takeover, to ease frictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mistrust persists, as evident from the Torkham situation. Pakistan
          remains concerned about militant activity across the porous border.
          Demanding documents from previously exempt truckers appears to be an
          attempt to tighten control and track movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The border crisis comes amid Pakistan&apos;s ongoing expulsion of
          hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghans, further straining ties.
          Since August 2022, over half a million Afghans without valid papers
          have been deported. Pakistan has long hosted nearly 1.7 million
          Afghans who fled the Soviet occupation and subsequent conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this latest standoff, trade and commerce between the two
          countries will be severely impacted. Torkham is a vital commercial
          artery and trade route to Central Asia for Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          For landlocked Afghanistan, access to the Arabian seaports through
          Pakistan is crucial for exports and imports. Disruptions at Torkham
          will choke key supplies of food, medicines and essential commodities.
          It may exacerbate Afghanistan&apos;s humanitarian crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the border remains closed to traffic, prices of goods transported
          by road may rise sharply in both nations. Transporters will also
          suffer major losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid greater public hardship, both sides will have to resolve the
          documentation dispute quickly through diplomatic channels. Wider
          engagement is also needed to address the core issues driving
          Pakistan&apos;s security concerns and perceived threat from
          Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restarting stalled talks between Taliban and Pakistani authorities on
          border management may help instil confidence. But for now, the
          unpredictable border situation highlights the delicate ties between
          the uneasy neighbours.

          The extreme overcrowding in Maharashtra&apos;s state prisons has led
          to a rise in skin diseases among inmates. To address this issue, the
          Maharashtra prison department has introduced washing machines in jails
          for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Yerwada Central Prison in Pune has become the first jail in the
          state to provide washing machines for inmates. So far, all jails have
          placed orders for 193 washing machines in total.
        </p>
        <p>
          On an experimental basis, nine washing machines were installed in
          Yerwada Central Prison last Friday. Prison officials said they would
          study the impact of using washing machines and based on the results,
          considering the needs, install up to 325 washing machines in all jails
          in the near future.

              Yerwada Prison has an official capacity of 2,753 inmates (2,536
              males, 226 females). But currently, there are 6,610 inmates -
              6,324 males and 286 females. Of these, 5,572 inmates are under
              judicial custody, 972 are convicts, and 66 are detained under the
              Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prison authorities said jails across the state face similar
              overcrowding. While overcrowding contributes to the rise in skin
              diseases, disinfecting inmates&apos; clothes and bedding through
              proper washing is essential for prevention, officials said.
            </p>
            <p>
              The introduction of washing machines follows the example of New
              Delhi&apos;s Tihar Jail. Maharashtra&apos;s prison department is
              taking a cue from there, said Amitabh Gupta, Additional Director
              General of Police (Prisons).
            </p>
            <p>
              While the exact number of inmates with skin diseases was

              inmates can quickly access information on their case status,
              account balance, hearing dates, and more. Inmates can also have

          Pushyamitra Bhargava left his successful legal career to become the
          mayor of Indore in 2022, promising to bring corporate culture to the
          municipal corporation. Recently, he has drawn attention for directing
          all malls and shops in Indore to install replicas of the Ram Temple in
          Ayodhya. He warned of consequences for those who fail to comply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two weeks ago, Bhargava wrote to all shopkeepers and malls,
          instructing them to install the replicas between January 15-22,
          coinciding with the temple&apos;s consecration anniversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, he justified the order, stating that if Christmas decor is

          also be permitted.
        </p>

          Before entering politics, Bhargava was the youngest additional

          Indore, he has an M.Phil in Law from Devi Ahilya University, a cyber
          law diploma from Mumbai, and a journalism certificate from Allahabad
          University. During college, he was active in the ABVP, the BJP&apos;s
          student wing.

        <p>
          Bhargava began his legal career under senior advocate Piyush Mathur, a
          former MP High Court judge. He rose to become the state&apos;s
          youngest deputy advocate general from 2015-2018. He represented the
          government in high-profile cases, including on medical oxygen supply
          during Covid, direct student union elections, and a web series
          allegedly insulting the army.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, Bhargava organized events supporting the Citizenship
          Amendment Act. He also led a &quot;Lawyers for Modi&quot; campaign for
          the 2019 elections. Additionally, he formed a youth organization
          called Sanghmitra to connect youth with patriotism and national
          service.

        <p>
          In the 2022 mayoral polls, Bhargava defeated his Congress opponent by
          a huge margin, becoming BJP&apos;s youngest Indore mayor. His Ram
          temple replica order has now sparked controversy.

        <p>
          Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has received his fourth summons
          from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning in the
          controversial Delhi excise policy case. The central agency has asked
          him to appear before it on January 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Kejriwal is likely to be in Goa from January 18-20 to oversee
          his Aam Aadmi Party&apos;s election preparations there, posing a
          scheduling conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Delhi CM has skipped ED questioning on three previous occasions,
          citing reasons like impending Rajya Sabha elections, Republic Day
          engagements as Chief Minister, and lack of response from the ED to his
          queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his latest communication to the ED Assistant Director, Kejriwal
          highlighted that the Election Commission has scheduled Rajya Sabha
          polls from Delhi on January 19. As national convener of AAP, which has
          fielded candidates, he is preoccupied with the nominations and
          campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, as Delhi CM, Kejriwal wrote he is busy with Republic Day
          event planning and preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the third instance of Kejriwal questioning the rationale
          behind ED&apos;s summons via written response instead of physically
          appearing. He expressed concern that despite comprehensively
          responding and raising legal objections, the ED chose not to provide
          clarification.
        </p>
        <p>
          In previous letters, Kejriwal termed the summons as politically
          motivated and alleged they were issued to harass him. He asked the ED
          to specify if he is being summoned as a witness or suspect and in what
          capacity. But the ED did not respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agency wants to question Kejriwal in connection with alleged
          irregularities in Delhi&apos;s now-scrapped excise policy. It claims
          kickbacks and corruption took place when the policy was formulated and
          implemented during Kejriwal&apos;s tenure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ED and CBI filed FIRs in the matter after Delhi LG Vinai Kumar
          Saxena recommended a probe. He alleged violations of rules and
          procedural lapses in the policy, which purportedly benefited private
          liquor dealers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides Deputy CM Manish Sisodia who handled the excise portfolio, the
          ED has questioned and arrested other AAP leaders and excise department
          officials. Sisodia has been questioned for over 30 hours so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          AAP has denied any wrongdoing and accused the BJP-led central
          government of a political witchhunt. Kejriwal earlier alleged he is
          being deliberately targeted to stop AAP&apos;s growing national
          footprint ahead of elections in various states.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ED summons have disrupted governance work, claimed AAP. However,
          the BJP retorted that if Kejriwal has done no wrong, he should not
          fear investigation agencies and cooperate.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Kejriwal unlikely to appear on January 18 given his engagements,
          it remains to be seen if the ED will relent or take a strong stand.
          The agency can ask a court to direct Kejriwal to join the probe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some analysts argue ED&apos;s repeated summons are creating an
          impression that it is overzealous about questioning Kejriwal. They
          suggest the agency should discuss the concerns raised in his letters
          before issuing fresh summons.
        </p>
        <p>
          As AAP aims to make inroads in Gujarat and other states, the timing of
          the probe is being seen as intended to dent its prospects. The tussle
          between the Centre and Delhi government looks set to continue, with
          both sides standing firm on their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kejriwal&apos;s non-appearance may provide more ammunition to BJP to
          allege he has something to hide. However, AAP is also likely to use it
          to claim victimization at the hands of the Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the impasse will end remains uncertain. But the excise case has
          certainly introduced new political drama and tensions between
          Delhi&apos;s ruling party and the central government.

          Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India&apos;s longest sea
          bridge, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri Nhava Sheva Atal Setu, also
          known as the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), on Friday. The bridge
          is named after former Prime Minister and BJP veteran Atal Bihari
          Vajpayee.
        </p>
        <p>
          This bridge is set to revolutionize travel for Mumbaikars by reducing
          the two-hour journey from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai to just 20 minutes.
          Under construction for the past six years at a massive cost of around
          Rs 20,000 crores, the Atal Setu has been hailed as a boon for
          commuters.
        </p>
        <p>
          By spanning 22 km over the sea, the bridge drastically cuts down the
          travel distance between Sewri in South Mumbai and Chirle near Nhava
          Sheva in Navi Mumbai from 42 km to 22 km. This not only saves precious
          time but also promotes fuel conservation, addressing a pressing
          concern in busy Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touted as India&apos;s longest sea bridge, the project includes a 16.5
          km long section over the sea and a 5.5 km elevated stretch over land.
          As per officials, it has a design capacity of 70,000 vehicles daily,
          enabling smooth travel at 100 km/hr on average.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting at Sewri and ending at Chirle near Nhava Sheva, the Atal Setu
          offers key interchanges at Sewri, Shivajinagar, State Highway 54, and
          NH-348. This strategic connectivity significantly enhances local links
          while also establishing vital access to Pune, Goa and southern India,
          promoting regional integration.

          After nearly 8 years, the wreckage of an Indian Air Force An-32
          aircraft that went missing in 2016 has finally been discovered on the
          seabed of the Bay of Bengal. The plane, with registration number
          K-2743, had disappeared during a flight from Port Blair to Chennai on
          July 22, 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday, the Indian Air Force announced that debris from the crashed
          aircraft has been located at a depth of approximately 3.4 km, around
          310 km off the Chennai coast. The discovery was made by India&apos;s
          National Institute of Ocean Technology using specialized deep sea
          search equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the IAF statement, NIOT recently deployed an advanced
          Autonomous Underwater Vehicle equipped with deep sea exploration
          capabilities to survey the aircraft&apos;s last known position.
          Multiple sensor payloads were utilized, including multi-beam sonar,
          synthetic aperture sonar and high-resolution photography. Analysis of
          the search imagery revealed the presence of aircraft debris on the
          seabed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were 29 people on board the ill-fated An-32 transport plane that
          fateful day in 2016. After the plane went missing mid-flight, an
          extensive search and rescue operation was launched over the Bay of
          Bengal but no signs of the aircraft or passengers were found.
          Eventually all 29 were presumed dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent discovery of the wreckage thus provides some closure after
          years of the aircraft&apos;s mysterious disappearance. Efforts will
          now focus on attempting to retrieve the flight data recorder as well
          as any remains to aid the investigation into this tragic incident. The
          families of the lost passengers and crew will also get some answers to
          the enduring questions surrounding the crash.

          The U.S. and British militaries bombed over a dozen sites used by
          Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on Thursday. The massive
          retaliatory strike utilized warship and submarine missiles alongside
          fighter jets to target air defenses, drone and missile storage, and
          launching locations, officials said.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden stated the strikes demonstrated the U.S. and allies
          &quot;will not tolerate&quot; the militant group&apos;s relentless
          attacks on the Red Sea. Biden said they only acted after attempts at
          diplomacy and careful consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strikes directly responded to unprecedented Houthi attacks on
          international ships, including first-time use of anti-ship ballistic
          missiles, endangering personnel and trade, Biden explained. He added
          he will take further measures as needed to protect people and
          commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Yemen&apos;s capital Sanaa, journalists heard four explosions early
          Friday local time. Residents in the port city of Hodeida said they
          heard five strong blasts. Witnesses also reported strikes in cities
          south of Sanaa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinated assault marked the first U.S. military response to the
          Houthis&apos; persistent attacks on commercial vessels since the
          Israel-Hamas war began. It came just a week after the U.S. and
          partners warned the Houthis to stop or risk potential military action.
          The warning briefly deterred attacks before the rebels&apos;
          largest-ever drone and missile barrage on shipping Tuesday, prompting
          U.S. and British ships to shoot down missiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials said after Tuesday&apos;s attacks, Biden met with advisors
          and directed the retaliatory strikes. The UK confirmed its Royal Air
          Force took part, with fighters from Cyprus. Allied nations joined the
          U.S. and UK in saying they won&apos;t hesitate to defend lives and
          commerce, though the aim is de-escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis vowed retaliation, warning any attack will spark a fierce
          response beyond imagination. Houthi-run media described strikes
          hitting bases, airports and camps. Casualties remain unclear.
          Officials don&apos;t expect the strikes will eliminate Houthi
          capabilities but may prompt retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis say their attacks aim to stop Israel&apos;s war in Gaza.
          But their targets increasingly have little connection to Israel while
          imperiling a crucial Asia-Europe trade route. The UN Security Council
          passed a resolution Wednesday demanding the Houthis immediately halt
          attacks and implicitly condemned their Iranian weapons suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The broad coalition battling the Houthis shows the Biden
          administration&apos;s effort to avoid appearing unilateral. Multiple
          ships have already been struck despite a U.S.-led maritime mission to
          protect shipping. The U.S. long declined to signal when patience would
          run out before Wednesday&apos;s warning of consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reluctance reflected sensitivities about the shaky Yemen truce and
          worries about triggering wider regional conflict. But the
          attacks&apos; impact on shipping and escalation triggered the
          coalition warning. The strikes underscored using a united front rather
          than opening a new war front alone.

          further investigations are underway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vikas was enrolled in the Aerospace Engineering department at IIT-K
          and originally hailed from Meerut. After visiting the campus and
          speaking to faculty and students, Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner
          Akhil Kumar shared some preliminary findings though noted the probe is
          still ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stated that on Wednesday evening, Vikas&apos;s death in his hostel
          room was reported and at first glance, it seems to be a potential
          suicide case. However, only after a full post-mortem examination and
          further investigations can police definitively determine causes and
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police have obtained a digital copy of a purported suicide note which
          cites some academic issues that Vikas was facing. The note apparently
          claims no one else should be blamed for his actions. However,
          authorities are still working to verify the authenticity of the note
          and confirm it was written by Vikas before his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to investigating officials, some of Vikas&apos;s peers had
          gone to his locked hostel room after not getting any response to their
          knocks. When he still did not respond, institute officials were
          informed and the room&apos;s lock was broken, only to discover
          Vikas&apos;s body hanging inside.

          termination notice from IIT-K which he could not timely appeal
          against. Anil claims Vikas felt he could have gotten the notice
          repealed if granted the appeal opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police are still holding on to Vikas&apos;s mobile phone and the
          alleged suicide note. Anil described his son as a very friendly person
          and believes the termination notice directly led to his suicide due to
          resulting depression.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, IIT-K officials clarified that such termination warning
          letters are meant to prompt students to meet with faculty and address
          their issues, and can be easily challenged to get revoked. But Vikas
          apparently did not take these steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its statement, IIT-K called Vikas an academically bright student
          who joined the MTech program in 2021. Losing him is a major loss for
          the institute and his passing is deeply upsetting, the statement
          added. Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner also mentioned having
          discussions with IIT-K&apos;s Director to ascertain the full
          circumstances and consider corrective actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The investigation into Vikas&apos;s tragic death remains ongoing as
          police work to conclusively determine the causes and events leading up
          to the suspected suicide. His family, friends and the IIT-K community
          are grieving the devastating loss of a promising young student and
          individual.

          An Ohio woman who was criminally charged for allegedly mishandling a
          home miscarriage will not be indicted, a grand jury decided on
          Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor&apos;s office in Trumbull County said the grand jury
          declined to charge Brittany Watts, 34, of Warren with abuse of a
          corpse. This resolved a controversial case that drew national
          attention for its implications for pregnant women as states enact new
          laws on reproductive healthcare access post - Roe v. Wade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision came just before around 150 supporters gathered for a
          rally supporting Watts in Warren&apos;s Courthouse Square. Watts
          addressed the crowd, thanking her community and declaring she will
          continue fighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watts&apos; attorney said an outpouring of public support helped her
          client endure being charged with a felony. The lawyer stated that
          despite how upsetting it sounds, Watts&apos; experience reflects the
          sad reality of miscarriage. They expressed relief and gratitude that
          the grand jury reached a just decision today.
        </p>
        <p>
          A municipal judge previously found probable cause against Watts.
          Prosecutors alleged she miscarried into a toilet, removed contents to
          outdoor trash, and left the 22-week fetus lodged in pipes. Records
          show her doctor advised hospital induction due to nonviable pregnancy
          and serious risks. But complications and delays prevented treatment.
          After miscarrying at home, she unsuccessfully tried going to a hair
          appointment before friends insisted she go to the hospital. A
          nurse&apos;s 911 call spurred the ensuing investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor argued the issue was not how or when the fetus died,
          but that Watts discarded it in the toilet, clogging it, and went about
          her day. An autopsy found the fetus died in utero with no recent
          injuries. Watts&apos; lawyer contended she had no criminal record and
          was being vilified for a common occurrence. The lawyer also questioned
          whether the abuse-of-corpse statute clearly defined terms like
          &quot;corpse&quot; and &quot;outrage&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          After binding the case over, the judge acknowledged better scholars
          should determine the fetus&apos;s precise legal status. Now, the
          prosecutor says further investigation found Watts committed no crime,
          despite disagreeing with the lower court&apos;s law application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advocates expressed relief at the outcome, but warned Watts&apos; case
          exemplifies the threats Black women face for pregnancy outcomes amid
          abortion restrictions. They called for ending the criminalization of
          reproductive outcomes, which undermines rights and deters necessary
          care. Watts hopes her experience prompts change through education and
          legislation so no other woman endures similar trauma fighting for
          freedom.

          In a tragic example of a failed romantic relationship, a man in Mumbai
          killed his partner. Three months ago, the pair connected on social
          media. The incident happened in Navi Mumbai&apos;s Turbhe. The crime
          blurred the lines between revenge and love when a 24-year-old man
          named Shoaib Sheikh planned the 35-year-old bank manager Amit Kaur—a
          divorcee and mother of a teenage girl was killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story started a few months ago, when Shoaib and Amit connected on
          social media. When Shoaib arrived in Turbhe on January 8th to
          celebrate Kaur&apos;s birthday, what appeared to be a blossoming
          romance took a dark turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the details given by the police, it appears that Shoaib
          killed Amit Kaur by strangulation in a lodge where they were
          celebrating, driven by feelings of suspicion and grief. Shoaib left
          the scene after carrying out the horrific deed, leaving the staff to
          discover the woman&apos;s lifeless body when they opened the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shoaib Sheikh was taken into custody by the Sakinaka police in Mumbai
          after they carried out an investigation. After being arrested, the
          young man—who worked in a garage—finally admitted to the crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the police, Shoaib&apos;s misgivings about his lover
          ultimately motivated him to commit the murder. The victim, a
          well-liked bank manager, had no idea what evil plans had been
          simmering inside of Shoaib.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic event clarified the effects of a relationship poisoned by
          suspicion and deceit. The community was left reeling from the shocking
          reality that had descended upon them as the legal proceedings
          progressed and the dark secrets underlying this bizarre story of love
          and betrayal continued to come to light.

          The word &quot;Veg&quot; is clearly visible on the wrapper of her food

          also irresistible. The woman continued to tweet &quot;When I told the

          Veera also appeared to be having trouble with the flight&apos;s

          Ankita Bhandari, 19, was murdered in September 2022 while working as a

          then, the murder has taken a new turn, with her mother calling for the
          arrest of a prominent member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party
          (BJP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother, Soni Devi, reportedly made the claim in a video,
          claiming that BJP MLA Renu Bisht had given the order to destroy
          evidence linked to the murder case by burning the victim&apos;s room
          at the Vanantra Resort, where her daughter worked as a receptionist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that BJP leader Vinod Arya&apos;s son Pulkit and two others
          were arrested following a furious public outcry following the
          disappearance of Ankita, whose body was subsequently discovered in
          Rishikesh&apos;s Chilla barrage. The luxurious resort&apos;s owner,
          Pulkit, is said to have thrown her into the water when she resisted
          being made to serve a VIP guest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl&apos;s mother also claimed that the state BJP secretary, Ajay
          Kumar, had appeared in witness statements nearly a year and a half
          after the crime, and she urged Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar
          Singh Dhami to act right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the intense public outcry surrounding the Ankita Bhandari
          murder case in 2022, the Uttarakhand Police assigned the case to a
          special investigation team (SIT) headed by senior IPS officer P Renuka
          Devi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Declaring that the Dhami government had betrayed her, Soni Devi
          expressed &quot;Arrest Ajay Kumar as it&apos;s evident that his name
          surfaced in the probe as the VIP who visited the resort,&quot; Soni
          Devi stated in the Sunday video statement. It added &quot;Arrest MLA
          Renu Bisht as well as Pramod Kumar, the former SDM, who gave the order
          for a JCB driver to destroy Ankita&apos;s room.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspector General of Police Nilesh Anand Bharne told news agency ANI
          that &quot;no evidence or statement about any VIP was presented during
          the investigation and testimony in court.&quot; He also stated that
          &quot;many serious allegations have been made by Ankita
          Bhandari&apos;s parents in the media and the social media about the
          so-called VIPs.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The accusations made by Ankita&apos;s mother have also been refuted by
          the BJP. &quot;In a fit of rage, Ankita&apos;s parents have made
          accusations, and the Congress party is expressing its frustration over
          electoral setbacks. The BJP leader&apos;s character is being attacked
          by the opposition using Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s remarks as
          cover. The government and the BJP are with the victim&apos;s family
          and justice will be done in the case as it is sub judice.&quot;, news
          reports as such cited a party leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a PTI report, Uttarakhand Congress president Karan Mahara
          shared Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s video statement and asked,
          &quot;When will Dhami answer our daughter Ankita Bhandari&apos;s
          mother&apos;s tears?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother further claimed in her statement that his wife
          had been sent to Pithoragarh and that the Dhami government had falsely
          filed a case against social worker Ashutosh Negi, who was assisting
          her in the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I will sacrifice my life if the case against Negi is not dropped
          soon and his wife&apos;s transfer is not cancelled,&quot; the woman
          declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahara stated that similar accusations had also been made by
          Ankita&apos;s father in a letter addressed to the Pauri District
          Magistrate, and that the entire incident ought to be looked into under
          the supervision of a sitting High Court judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It is imperative that action be taken against these allegations
          if there is even the slightest degree of truth,&quot; he declared.

          Regarding disqualification petitions submitted by organizations led by
          former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Shinde, Rahul Narwekar
          rendered a decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Wednesday, the Speaker declared that the Thackeray-led faction had
          not submitted any documentation indicating that a meeting of the Shiv
          Sena&apos;s national executive had taken place to determine which
          faction of the party was the legitimate one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court gave Narwekar another deadline extension on December
          15, ordering him to make a decision on the petitions by January 10.
          The Maharashtra Speaker was initially instructed by a five-judge bench
          led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud to hear and rule on the
          disqualification petitions within a “reasonable time” in May of last
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena broke up in June 2022 when Chief Minister Eknath Shinde
          rebelled against Thackeray&apos;s Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition,
          claiming the backing of 39 of the party&apos;s 55 MLAs in addition to
          10 independent MLAs. In the government, allies included the Congress,
          the Nationalist Congress Party, and the Shiv Sena.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Thackeray faction has demanded the disqualification of Shinde and
          other MLAs. There were 34 such petitions pending before the Speaker in
          total.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Thackeray, had petitioned the Supreme

          The Supreme Court ruled in May that former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat
          Singh Koshyari had erred in concluding that the Shinde-led rebellion

          Positioned along the cocaine trade route that connects Peru and

          violence.

          According to AFP, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa declared a state
          of &quot;internal armed conflict&quot; due to the ongoing situation,
          which has resulted in at least 10 deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noboa approved military operations against the nation&apos;s most
          powerful criminal organizations on Tuesday, following the takeover of
          a television studio by masked gunmen and threats made by gang members
          against law enforcement and civilians.

              Gangs that are connected to powerful cartels in Mexico and
              Colombia, most notably Los Choneros, have committed acts of
              violence, including attacking television studios, setting off
              explosions in numerous cities, and kidnapping police officers.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the largest gang in Ecuador, Los Choneros, led by Jose
              Adolfo Macias, also known as &quot;Fito,&quot; escaped, President
              Noboa declared a state of emergency and instituted a curfew for
              the evening hours on Monday.
            </li>
            <li>
              Later, groups affiliated with cartels from Mexico and Colombia,
              including Ecuadorian gangs, detonated bombs in multiple cities and
              kidnapped multiple police officers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Armed with guns, these gang members broke into a TC television
              studio in the port city of Guayaquil on Tuesday. &quot;Don&apos;t
              shoot, please don&apos;t shoot,&quot; pleaded a woman&apos;s voice
              over gunfire during a live TC broadcast.

            <li>
              After police broke into the studio, thirteen people were taken

            <li>
              Ecuador is a prime target for drug trafficking organizations due
              to its strategic location on the cocaine trade route that connects
              Peru and Colombia.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Ecuador, drug-related violence has been on the rise for a long
              time; between 2018 and 2022, the murder rate quadrupled, peaking
              at over 7,800 killings last year.
            </li>
            <li>
              In an effort to increase their power and influence, rival gangs
              connected to the cartels in Mexico and Colombia fight for control
              of drug routes and territory in Ecuador.
            </li>
            <li>
              The country&apos;s faltering economy, in addition to extreme
              poverty and inequality, has made it an ideal environment for gang
              recruitment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unrest within Ecuador&apos;s penitentiaries and an inefficient
              prison system that allows well-known criminals to evade justice
              have both substantially contributed to the rise in violence.

        <p>
          MATATO stated that they &quot;did not reflect sentiments of Maldivians
          in general&quot; and urged EaseMyTrip to ignore them. MATATO
          emphasized that Indian travelers are indispensable force in the
          success of the Maldivian tourism sector, providing vital support to
          small to medium-sized enterprises&quot; highlighting the need for
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a statement, the Maldives tourism board praised Indian visitors,
          who have become the country&apos;s largest group of foreign visitors
          since COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;As we offer our sincere thanks for the long-lasting friendship
          and cooperation that characterize the Maldives&apos; relationship with
          India, we want you to know that these ties go beyond issues of
          politics. We love and cherish our Indian counterparts as brothers and
          sisters.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With over two-thirds of the Maldives&apos; GDP coming from the
          tourism industry and 44,000 Maldivians employed in it, tourism is the
          lifeblood of the islands. The possible negative effect on tourism has
          the capacity to have catastrophic effects on our economy.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on information provided by the Maldives Tourism Ministry, over
          4.5 lakh Indian tourists have come to the nation over the previous two
          years, including over two lakh visitors last year. When the Maldives
          was still open to visitors, approximately 63,000 Indians went there
          despite the pandemic.
        </p>

          Earlier, the Maldives Association of Tourism Industry (MATI) denounced
          remarks made disparagingly about Prime Minister Modi. MATATO also
          urged people to abstain from using offensive language that exacerbates
          division.

          &quot;There has been a noticeable increase in the number of people
          being duped by dubious and unlawful lending apps. Many people who
          become entangled in the network of these apps often turn to extreme
          measures, like suicide. Two new illicit lending apps appear for each
          one that is banned. It&apos;s turned into a whack-a-mole game,&quot;
          Kamath wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went on to discuss the strategies these apps employ to generate
          revenue. &quot;The fact that many of these apps deduct as much as 10%
          upfront is what makes them disgusting,&quot; he said. Furthermore,
          interest rates can vary from fifty percent to one hundred percent, or
          even higher. People that borrow money through these applications are
          unable to return it on such exorbitant terms. However, since that
          users of these apps are in need, they overlook the fine print.&quot;

          He further warned individuals that these loan sharks may use physical
          threats in order to get money back at the conclusion of his tweet. By
          phoning all of their contacts and sharing their private images, they
          can also harass others.

              Instead of hiring a taxi, which is an expensive option, the staff

              less expensive, the police officer said.

              The woman insisted that she would only take a taxi, and on January

              The apartment&apos;s management notified the Calangute Police
              right away.
            </p>

              In addition, the staff reported to the police that Seth was seen
              carrying an abnormally heavy bag when she left the apartment and
              that her four-year-old son was not seen with her.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, she received a call from the police asking her about
              her missing son and the bloodstains.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response, the woman said that her monthly period was to blame
              for the bloodstains. She gave the address and mentioned that her
              son was in Margao town, South Goa, with her friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Naik, the police realized right away that the address
              she had provided was a fake after enlisting the assistance of the
              Fatorda Police (near Margao).
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, the taxi driver, who was traveling to Bengaluru and had
              arrived in the Karnataka district of Chitradurga, was instructed
              by the inspector over the phone to transport the accused person to
              the closest police station.

              According to Naik, when the Chitradurga police examined the

          Amidst the controversy surrounding a Maldivian minister&apos;s
          disparaging comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Parliamentary
          Minority Leader Ali Azim of the Maldives demanded on Monday that
          Mohamed Muizzu, the president of the archipelago nation, be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noting that the foreign policy of the country remains stable, Azim
          called for a motion of no confidence to be put out against Muizzu.
        </p>
        <p>
          He asked in a post on X (previously Twitter), &quot;We, d Democrats, r
          dedicated to upholding d stability of the nation&apos;s foreign policy
          n preventing d isolation of any neighboring country. R u willing to
          take all necessary steps to remove prez @MMuizzu from power? Is
          @MDPSecretariat prepared to initiate a vote of no confidence?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This follows a controversy that started when a few Maldivian
          politicians disparaged Prime Minister Modi and made fun of his most
          recent trip to Lakshadweep. India brought up the issue with Male in a
          strong manner, and the leaders of the island nation&apos;s opposition
          criticized the ruling class for the disagreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maldivian deputy minister of youth empowerment, Mariyam Shiuna,
          made a derogatory and mocking reference to Prime Minister Modi in a
          post that has since been removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comments incited a fierce backlash in India. The Maldives
          government rejected the disparaging remarks, claiming they did not
          reflect Male&apos;s opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three deputy ministers were also suspended by the Maldivian government
          on Sunday for disparaging remarks about Prime Minister Modi on social
          media. Ibrahim Khaleel, a spokesman for the Maldivian president,
          stated, &quot;All government officials responsible for the comments
          have been suspended from their post effective immediately.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the row, a number of well-known Indians, including cricketer
          Sachin Tendulkar, actor Akshay Kumar, actor Salman Khan, and actor
          Aakash Chopra, joined an online campaign advocating for a boycott of
          the Maldives and its tourist attractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amidst the boycott of the Maldives, online travel agency EaseMyTrip
          declared that &quot;country comes before business&quot; and that it
          would suspend all reservations for flights to the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          PM Modi visited the union territory on January 2 and posted a number
          of photos, including one of him snorkelling, which he described as a
          &quot;exhilarating experience.&quot; PM Modi posted images of the
          ocean, snow-white beaches, and clear blue skies on X, captioning them
          with the words, &quot;Lakshadweep has to be on your list for those who
          wish to embrace the adventurer in them.&quot;

          The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Kyiv was using missiles made in the
          West to attack Russian targets, but it declined to comment on claims
          made by the US and Ukraine that Moscow had fired North Korean missiles
          at targets in Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The White House announced last week that Russia had launched several
          strikes against Ukraine using short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs)
          that were obtained from North Korea, citing recently declassified
          intelligence. Later on, a senior Ukrainian official confirmed the
          report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, both Moscow and Pyongyang
          have grown closer, despite their denials of having any arms deals. In
          September of last year, President Vladimir Putin and North Korean
          leader Kim Jong Un met in the Far East of Russia, and senior Russian
          officials have since visited Pyongyang multiple times.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about the allegations made by the United States and
          Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded, &quot;No
          comment&quot;, to a call with reporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peskov said that Ukraine had been using missiles made by
          &quot;Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and other
          countries&quot; to strike civilian targets inside Russia on multiple
          occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 30, an attack by Ukraine on the Russian border city of
          Belgorod resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including two
          children, and 111 injuries, according to Russian media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Belgorod region, which borders northern Ukraine, has experienced
          drone attacks and shelling this year, similar to other Russian border
          zones, which the authorities have attributed to Ukraine, though none
          had ever been this severe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stated goals of Moscow&apos;s Feb. 24, 2022, deployment of tens of
          thousands of troops into Ukraine were &quot;demilitarising&quot; and
          &quot;denazifying&quot; the nation. Moscow has stated that Western
          countries, including the US, are accountable for the fallout from
          arming Kyiv.

          After forty years, the greater one-horned rhinoceros has made a
          comeback to the Laokhowa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary in central
          Assam, according to officials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until 1983, there were at least 45 rhinos living in the 309.2 sq.
          km. wildlife sanctuary (WLS) in the Nagaon district, which is a part
          of the Greater Kaziranga landscape. Although stray rhinos from Orang
          National Park across the Brahmaputra River and the Kaziranga National
          Park to the east were known to briefly enter the WLS, widespread
          encroachment and poaching ultimately led to their extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the return of our famous rhinos to Laokhowa
          and Burachapori, after a 40-year absence, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa
          Sarma posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday night. Stating that
          they had returned within a year of our successful anti-encroachment
          operation in the area. He also mentioned that following the eviction
          drive in 2023, 51.7 square kilometers of forest cover had been
          recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to wildlife officials, the two rhinos are thought to have
          entered through Arimari, where between February 13 and 15, 2023,
          encroachers were removed from 1,282 hectares of forest land and 817
          hectares of unsurveyed government land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since November 2023, rhinos have been seen in Laokhowa-Burachapori, a
          great place for freshwater mangroves to live. The WLS also has ten
          tigers on file, suggesting a healthy base of herbivorous prey for
          these animals, according to Kaziranga&apos;s field director, Sonali
          Ghosh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent filling of 75 frontline positions and the recruitment of
          new personnel have been credited with increasing sanctuary protection.

          airport in Fujian, he was observed being welcomed by Chinese
          officials. President Xi Jinping of China has invited Muizzu and his
          spouse on a state visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Muizzu of the Maldives is on his first bilateral visit since
          taking office on December 17 of last year. Rumor has it that during
          Muizzu&apos;s visit, China and the Maldives will have formal
          discussions and sign important agreements to improve trade,
          professional growth, and socioeconomic cooperation.

          Muizzu will also meet important Chinese business executives at the
          Invest Maldives Forum in Fuzhou. The President&apos;s Office of the
          Maldives released a statement saying, &quot;The visit aims to pave the
          way for technological and other collaborations between the two

          On October 14, 1972, China and the Maldives established diplomatic

          Social media was rocked by Maldivian politicians&apos; remarks about
          Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&apos;s visit to Lakshadweep, which
          revealed more about the two nations&apos; relationship than just

          Mohamed Muizzu, the recently elected president of the Maldives, has
          requested that India remove its troops from the island nation. The
          troops are in charge of three exquisite aircraft that are being used
          for patrol.
        </p>
        <p>
          What really infuriated Indians, though, were remarks made by
          politicians in the Maldives that were deemed racist. As a result, many
          Indians called for a boycott of travel to the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous well-known people have expressed their support for
          Modi&apos;s expedition and encouraged tourists to visit Indian
          islands.

            Maldives tourism is dominated by India

          <p>
            The tourism industry, which generates the majority of the
            country&apos;s foreign exchange earnings and government revenue, is
            a major contributor to the Maldivian economy. Due to its gorgeous
            beaches, opulent lodging options, and mouthwatering seafood, the
            island nation has become a popular travel destination in South Asia.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Maldivian Tourism Ministry reports that 161,751 arrivals from
          India were registered in November 2023 alone, making up nearly 20% of
          all arrivals. In the meantime, Indians held the second position in
          market share from January to November 2023, accounting for 10.9
          percent of all arrivals, or 181, 371 arrivals, in the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          India ranked as the fifth-largest country from which tourists arrived
          in the Maldives in 2018. Approximately 6.1% (more than 90,474) of the
          14,84,274 tourists came from India. Nevertheless, India ranked second
          in 2019 with 1,66,030 arrivals, nearly twice as many as the previous
          year. With almost 63,000 Indian tourists visiting the Maldives in the
          pandemic-hit year 2020, India accounted for the Maldives&apos; largest
          source market. With over 2.91 lakh and 2.41 lakh tourist arrivals from
          India, respectively, and a 23 percent and 14.4 percent market share,
          India remained the leading market in 2021 and 2022.

            Education, finance, and defense: India helps the Maldives
          </span>
          <p>
            India and the Maldives have collaborated closely in defense and
            security since 1988. Regarding meeting the Maldives&apos;
            requirements for defense hardware and training, India has been
            incredibly accommodating and adaptable. As of late, it has signed a
            comprehensive Action Plan for Defence in April 2016 and has
            continued to provide defense hardware, upgrade defense
            infrastructure, and train Maldivian forces.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Regarding financial support, the Maldives received an additional $100
          million in funding from the Modi administration in November 2022. The
          help came in the shape of budgetary support to help the archipelago
          nation get through its challenging economic times. It should be
          mentioned that the aid is being provided unconditionally, and the
          Maldives has been allowed to use it however it sees fit to aid in its
          economic recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          India further solidified its reputation as the “first responder” when
          it quickly sent 30,000 doses of the measles vaccine to the Maldives in
          January 2020 to stop an outbreak. India also provided the Maldives
          with prompt, all-encompassing assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, a number of young Maldivians attend Indian universities to
          pursue higher education. For many years, Maldivian schools located
          throughout the islands have employed Indian educators. Maldivian youth
          have historically been awarded a significant number of ICCR
          scholarships by India, specifically 39 for 2021-2022 and 34+ for
          2022-2023 & 2023-2024.

            series; people can die, be consumed, beaten, tortured, shot,

            violence isn&apos;t depicted any more graphically than it would be
            in a show like Game of Thrones. Characters are occasionally seen
            smoking and drinking wine, but these scenes don&apos;t have a
