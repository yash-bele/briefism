          The intense trailer for actor Dhanush&apos;s upcoming film Captain
          Miller was unveiled Saturday, offering a glimpse into the movie&apos;s
          action-packed narrative. Dhanush portrays a violent character fiercely
          determined to battle British forces in the film.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nearly 3-minute trailer is filled with gunshots, swordfights,
          explosions and other high-octane sequences, previewing the
          movie&apos;s frenetic action. Dhanush appears to be defending his
          village and its mines against the British troops. Towards the end,
          it&apos;s revealed he was formerly a British soldier himself who held
          the rank of Captain Miller.

          The Central Board of Film Certification in India recently instructed
          the makers of Captain Miller to reduce violence in final scenes by 40%
          and mute derogatory language toward the British, including words like
          &quot;white dogs.&quot; The board also asked for adjustments to bloody
          visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by Arun Matheshwaran, the film stars Dhanush along with
          Priyanka Arul Mohan, Shivaraj Kumar, Nivedita Sathish, Vinayakan and
          Sandeep Kishan. Captain Miller has received a U/A certificate and is
          slated for release on January 12.

          painting depicting Salome clutching John the Baptist&apos;s head.

        <p>
          Spears has previously stated that she will no longer be releasing her
          own music. Larry Rudolph, her longtime manager, resigned in July 2021,
          while she was still under the notorious conservatorship that ruled her
          life, finances, and voice for nearly 14 years. Rudolph stated that she
          had no plans to resume her profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that year, shortly after her conservatorship ended, she posted
          on Instagram expressing her fear of the music industry and her belief
          that not releasing her own songs was a sign of disobedience to her
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in 2022, she dropped the single &quot;Hold Me Closer,&quot; a
          joint effort with Elton John, which peaked at No. 6 and remained on
          the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 20 weeks. The single &quot;Mind Your
          Business,&quot; which featured will.i.am, was not included in the Hot
          100 and received negative reviews. 2016&apos;s &quot;Glory&quot; was
          Spears&apos; most recent full-length album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spears said in the Wednesday post that it was &quot;far from the
          truth&quot; that her best-selling memoir from 2023, &quot;The Woman In
          Me,&quot; was published without her consent.

        Barroz, directed by and starring Mohanlal, is made in 3D, and it is the
        next big venture of the Malayalam star after Malaikottai Vaaliban.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal, who has spent decades as a household name in the Malayalam
        film industry, has chosen to take on the role of director for Barraoz,
        which is a movie adaption of Barroz: Guardian of D&apos;Gama&apos;s
        Treasure by Lijo Punnoose. The pandemic delayed the release of the
        movie, which had been first announced in 2019. Following a number of
        adjustments, such as Punnoose&apos;s departure from the project, Barroz
        appears to be nearing completion. Mohanlal has welcomed 2024 with a
        fresh movie poster as reassurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal is shown holding a sword and sitting on a hollow horse in the
        poster. He is as majestic as they come, and the legend of the horse
        piques curiosity and raises questions about the world of Barroz.
        <br />
        <br />
        Barroz&apos;s book is based on a legend regarding Vasco da Gama&apos;s
        treasure, who traveled through Kerala to reach India. Considering that
        the novel was written by Lijo Punnoose, the man behind the first 3D film
        in India, My Dear Kuttichathan (1984), one can anticipate a visually
        stunning and all-around family-friendly film.
        <br />
        <br />
        The film stars Pranav Mohanlal alongside Ignacio Mateos, Ceast Lorente
        Raton, Guru Somasundaram, and Komal Sharma. The film&apos;s soundtrack
        is being composed by South African composer Mark Kilian, while Lydian
        Nadharswaram is in charge of the songs.

        Rinku Dhawan and Neil Bhatt, two competitors, left the Bigg Boss 17
        house last night. Both of them, especially Rinku, who aimed to be
        impartial and least affected on the show, played the game with grace.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even about Munawar Faruqui&apos;s private life being dragged on the
        show, Rinku Dhawan expressed her opinions. &quot;Nobody deserves such a
        public trial, Munawar or anybody else,&quot; she declared. We must
        exercise tact. It&apos;s just wrong to publicly criticize others and
        make disparaging remarks. Munawar&apos;s problem was unnecessary and
        went too far.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku continued, &quot;Yes, Mannara is behind Munawar,&quot; in
        reference to Mannara Chopra and Ayesha Khan. I also informed her during
        the show that our friendship is only genuine until all the requirements
        are met. You have to start doubting that friendship the moment they
        don&apos;t. This implies that it is biased. I am unable to determine
        whether Ayesha has defamed Munawar because she has her own narrative,
        which he is not disputing. However, she could have waited since they
        both acknowledged that they were not committed, so yes, she picked the
        wrong moment and venue to apologize. Munawar could have handled it even
        then; she could have returned with the trophy after the show.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku Dhawan speaks out against the toxic masculinity that exists on the
        show, even though she is certain that Munawar will win the trophy.
        &quot;Abhishek&apos;s outbursts of rage at home are inappropriate. And
        no one speaks out against it. Munawar is harmful to himself and wrong to
        not deal with his circumstances and find closure. Vicky needs to make
        amends for his ability to playfully step on people&apos;s feelings in
        order to get ahead of them all.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku went on to say that there is no chance of reconciliation between
        Abhishek and Isha; in fact, she said of Vicky and Ankita&apos;s ongoing
        arguments, &quot;Vicky and Ankita are both strong personalities, so when
        they come on this big platform, they will clash.&quot;

        Bollywood star John Abraham recently bought an opulent bungalow in
        Mumbai&apos;s sought-after Khar neighborhood. With a price tag of Rs
        70.83 crore, the property is large, measuring 5,416 square feet. The
        actor also purchased the 7,722 square foot plot of land that the
        bungalow is located on.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the help of property registration documents that IndexTap.com was
        able to obtain, the deal was formally registered on December 27, 2023.
        Moneycontrol.com claims that John paid Rs 4.24 crore in stamp duty for
        the property.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abhraham&apos;s new residence is situated in the heart of
        Mumbai&apos;s lively residential area, on the Linking Road in Khar, one
        of the city&apos;s busiest shopping thoroughfares. In addition to its
        commercial significance, the area is well-known for being close to a
        number of educational institutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to space restrictions, Bollywood stars usually prefer to live
        vertically in upscale apartments; however, industry veterans are
        typically the ones who own the horizontal properties. Based on data
        gathered from the website, residential real estate in Khar is priced
        between Rs 40,000 and Rs 90,000 per square foot.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abraham&apos;s action comes in the wake of the recent publicity
        surrounding Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan, who made waves by giving
        his daughter Shweta Bachchan ownership of his Juhu-based bungalow,
        Prateeksha. The ownership transfer, valued at approximately Rs 50.63
        crore, was formalized on November 8 with the filing of two distinct gift
        deeds and the payment of Rs 50.65 lakh in stamp duty.
        <br />
        <br />
        John&apos;s most recent film appearance was in Pathaan, starring Shah
        Rukh Khan. In the movie, he portrayed an antagonist. John is working on
        several projects at the moment, such as Vedaa, Tariq, Tehran, and The
        Diplomat.

        Numerous sightings of Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan together have
        sparked rumors that they have been dating since 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        The actors Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan have long been the focus of
        dating rumors. This rumor started because of the photos where Ibrahim
        was spotted at Palak&apos;s house. The young actors haven&apos;t
        revealed their relationship to the public despite being frequently
        spotted together. But when they were spotted together last night on New
        Year&apos;s Eve, dating rumors were sparked. The focus of the video was
        Ibrahim&apos;s choice to keep his face hidden from the paparazzi.
        <br />
        <br />
        Palak Tiwari, the Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan actor, was spotted in a car
        with Ibrahim Ali Khan and another friend. However, when they saw the
        photographers, Sara Ali Khan&apos;s brother and Saif Ali Khan&apos;s son
        had an unexpected reaction. In the video, Ibrahim can be seen covering
        his face with his jacket. Rumors of a romantic relationship between
        Palak and Ibrahim date back to 2022. In fact, Shweta Tiwari&apos;s
        daughter Palak clarified in one of her interviews that Ibrahim is just a
        &quot;nice friend.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of her career, Palak is preparing to play herself in the film
        The Virgin Tree, which also features Mouni Roy and Sanjay Dutt. But
        Ibrahim will make his Bollywood debut in Sarzameen, which is also
        starring Kajol and is directed by Kayoze, Boman Irani&apos;s son.

        presents the actor&apos;s character from a different angle.

        The new poster features Mammootty&apos;s character wearing a crown that
        looks like it was worn by those who practiced the ancient folk ritual
        art form of Theyyam. It also has makeup that suggests Mammootty is not
        your typical human, and it has attached horns. Bramayugam, directed by
        Rahul Sadasivan, who rose to fame with his first feature Bhoothakaalam,
        is a full-fledged horror movie with a strong historical setting in
        Kerala&apos;s dark ages. The movie&apos;s chilling premise is further
        highlighted by its tagline, &quot;the age of madness.&quot;

        With the release of the most recent poster, Mammootty wished all of his
        fans a happy New Year. Bramayugam, which was co-produced by Night Shift
        Studios and YNot Studios, also stars Shehnad Jalal as director of
        photography, Shafique Mohammed Ali as editor, and Christo Xavier as
        music composer. Notable roles are played by Arjun Ashokan, Sidharth
        Bharathan, and Amalda Liz.

        &quot;I am thrilled to be living the dream of directing the iconic
        Mammookka,&quot; Rahul declared at the beginning of the movie&apos;s
        production, which wrapped up in October. Bramayugam is a deeply felt
        tale that takes place in Kerala&apos;s dark ages, and I&apos;m happy
        that the producers are pushing the envelope to create an immersive
        cinematic experience. I hope fans of the genre everywhere as well as
        those of Mammookka will find it delightful.

        unsubstantiated rumors that it will premiere in February. The film will
        be released in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi in addition to its
        original Malayalam version.
