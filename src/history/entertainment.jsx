          Hrithik Roshan is pinning his hopes on &quot;Fighter,&quot; a
          high-budget aerial action film directed by Siddharth Anand, to reclaim
          lost momentum at the box office. The movie, also featuring Anil Kapoor
          and Deepika Padukone, hit theaters on January 25, just ahead of the
          Republic Day holiday weekend. According to industry tracker Sacnilk,
          &quot;Fighter&quot; is anticipated to rake in Rs 25 crore on its
          opening day. While this would be considered one of Hrithik&apos;s top
          debuts, it falls short of the record set by his biggest hit, Siddharth
          Anand&apos;s &quot;War,&quot; which made double that amount on its
          first day at the same time last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by Siddharth, &quot;Fighter&quot; managed to secure over Rs
          8.4 crore in advance ticket sales prior to its release and is reported
          to have been produced with a budget of Rs 250 crore. Hrithik and
          Siddharth have previously collaborated on successful projects such as
          &quot;Bang Bang!&quot; and &quot;War,&quot; both of which delivered
          Hrithik&apos;s top debuts. &quot;Fighter&quot; has the potential to
          join this list, with box office earnings expected to surge on Republic
          Day, a national holiday falling on Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, &quot;Bang Bang!&quot; achieved an opening day collection of
          Rs 27 crore, while &quot;War&quot; set a new record with Rs 53 crore
          on its first day, a record that has since been surpassed. If
          &quot;Fighter&quot; manages to exceed the Rs 25.5 crore opening of
          &quot;Krrish 3&quot; from a decade ago by just Rs 50 lakh, it will
          secure the position as Hrithik&apos;s third-highest debut.
          Siddharth&apos;s personal best remains &quot;Pathaan,&quot; which
          earned Rs 57 crore on its opening day around the same time last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the blockbuster success of &quot;War&quot; in 2019, Hrithik has
          appeared in only one film, &quot;Vikram Vedha,&quot; a gangster drama
          co-starring Saif Ali Khan. Despite being considered an under-performer
          with earnings below Rs 80 crore in India, Hrithik&apos;s star power in
          the pre-pandemic era helped films like &quot;Super 30&quot; and
          &quot;Kaabil&quot; cross the coveted Rs 100 crore mark domestically.

          Renowned musician Rahat Fateh Ali Khan recently held a press
          conference to announce a change in his management, handing over the
          reins to his wife, Nida Rahat, and other family members. This decision
          marks a departure from his previous management led by music and
          concert producer Salman Ahmed. Khan shared this update on social
          media, urging clients not to make payments to his former management.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video of the press conference shared on social media, Khan
          stated, “RFAK (his music company in Pakistan) is merging with NRK,
          whose president is my wife and her brother Mohd Baqa Niazi, who is in
          New Jersey. My brothers Ashar Anwar, Maroof Ali Khan, and Raja Umair
          Hussain are working with me locally in Pakistan. We have parted ways
          with our previous management in a peaceful and lovely way.”
        </p>
        <p>
          However, alongside this announcement, the music maestro cautioned his
          clients against making payments to his previous management. He
          emphasized, “I will request our clients not to make any payments to
          our previous management. I would like them to make payments only if
          they have my signature on the receiving end. Earlier, I didn’t pay
          attention to these things, and a lot of clients, who were associated
          with me because of their love for me, have been trapped because of
          these payments. Such episodes should not be repeated, and this is one
          of the main reasons that I have conducted this press conference.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Salman Ahmed, who managed Rahat Fateh Ali Khan for the past 12 years,
          responded to the singer&apos;s allegations, dismissing them as false.
          He asserted that he has documentation for all transactions and is
          prepared to present it to Pakistan’s Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR)
          and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ahmed stated, “Only 5 days before the press conference, the maestro
          had asked me to meet him and finalize his UK tour and other dates
          which he had committed with me.” He went on to claim that over the
          past decade, he handled not only Khan’s business affairs, managing
          three marriages and children, but also served as a protective shield.
          Ahmed expressed disappointment in the baseless allegations and
          emphasized that Rahat Fateh Ali Khan undervalued his sincerity. He
          concluded, “It is show time now. The world will see the reality.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Before gaining international acclaim, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan was a
          prominent singer in Pakistan. He has lent his voice to numerous Hindi
          film songs, including &quot;O Re Piya&quot; (Aaja Nachle), &quot;Teri
          Ore&quot; (Singh Is Kinng), &quot;Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji&quot;
          (Ishqiya), &quot;Sanu Ek Pal Chain&quot; (Raid), and many others.

        <p>
          Amitabh Bachchan, renowned for his distinctive baritone, presented an
          unexpected challenge for director Sanjay Gupta during the production
          of the film Kaante. In a recent interview, Gupta disclosed that Kaante
          marked a significant departure for Bachchan as it was likely his first
          film shot entirely in sync sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a conversation with Siddharth Kannan, Sanjay reminisced,
          &quot;I remember when I started shooting for Kaante… Kaante was
          sync-sound, and everybody had to be in their natural space. And I
          don’t think Amit ji had ever done anything in sync-sound before
          that.&quot; He recounted a specific rehearsal for a scene involving
          Big B, Suniel Shetty, and Kumar Gaurav, where everyone, excluding
          Amitabh, was instructed to speak in their normal, conversational tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the rehearsal, Sanjay Gupta and Sanjay Dutt shared a knowing
          look, acknowledging the need to address Amitabh Bachchan&apos;s unique
          vocal style. &quot;When the rehearsal happened, me and Sanju exchanged
          looks and I was thinking, now who bells the cat?&quot; Gupta
          humorously recalled. The decision was made to approach Bachchan and
          delicately suggest modifying his vocal delivery to better align with
          the sync sound requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a one-on-one discussion with Bachchan, Gupta conveyed the
          intricacies of sync sound and the impact of vocal delivery on the
          overall audio dynamics of the film. &quot;I remember I sat down with
          him. I said ‘Sir, I just wanted to tell you something. I just heard
          the recording…’ I hadn’t listened to anything by then. I told him that
          his voice was getting distorted, so he had to (gestures to lower it
          down) because the rest of them are speaking softly. He asked ‘you want
          me to take it softer?’ I said ‘yes, more natural.’ He gave me that
          look ‘what do you mean more natural?’ But after that, everything was a
          piece of cake,&quot; Gupta shared, emphasizing the collaborative and
          adaptable nature of the interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          This candid exchange highlighted the importance of effective
          communication between a director and actor in navigating challenges
          during the filmmaking process. The adjustment made during that
          discussion allowed for a more harmonious blending of voices in sync
          sound, ultimately enhancing the overall cinematic experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same interview, Gupta offered insights into the early planning
          stages of Kaante. Initially conceived as a film featuring newcomers,
          the creative direction took a turn after discussions with Sanjay Dutt.
          Dutt&apos;s encouragement led Gupta to envision Kaante as a
          large-scale cinematic endeavor, departing from the initial plan. The
          film drew significant inspiration from Quentin Tarantino&apos;s iconic
          work, &quot;Reservoir Dogs.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Released in 2002, Kaante presented a narrative revolving around a
          group of convicts planning a major heist, exploring themes of loyalty,
          betrayal, and camaraderie. The film&apos;s ensemble cast, including
          Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Kumar Gaurav, Lucky Ali,
          and Mahesh Manjrekar, delivered impactful performances that resonated
          with the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the initial challenge posed by the shift to sync sound and the
          need for adjustments in Bachchan&apos;s vocal delivery, Kaante emerged
          as a unique cinematic offering that seamlessly blended action, drama,
          and heist elements. The collaborative efforts of the cast and crew,
          coupled with Gupta&apos;s visionary direction, resulted in a film that
          left an indelible mark on Bollywood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kaante experience serves as a testament to the adaptive skills of
          seasoned actors like Amitabh Bachchan and the collaborative spirit
          within the film industry. It underscores the commitment to delivering
          authentic performances and the willingness to embrace new techniques
          for the betterment of the cinematic craft. As Bachchan&apos;s baritone
          adapted to the nuances of sync sound, it added another layer to his
          illustrious career, showcasing his versatility and dedication to his
          craft.

          Vicky Jain, who faced eviction from Bigg Boss 17 just days before the
          grand finale, is making headlines for hosting a party with other
          ousted contestants. Despite enjoying his post-eviction celebrations,

          concerns. Ankita has even discussed her plan to scrutinize the CCTV
          footage from their home to identify the attendees of the party during
          her absence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the recent episode, Ankita greeted the morning by saying,
          &apos;good morning Vicku.&apos; Abhishek Kumar responded, &quot;He
          must be going to sleep now, after partying.&quot; Ankita concurred,
          stating, &quot;I also feel like he must be partying a lot. No one is

          going back to see who all came.&quot;

          Mannara Chopra appeared puzzled and questioned Ankita about whether

          Vicky Jain recently organized a lively house party with friends and
          former contestants Isha Malviya, Ayesha Khan, and Sana Raees Khan.
          Pictures from the gathering, taken at Vicky and Ankita&apos;s
          residence, are circulating on the internet. Vicky&apos;s sister,
          Khushi Jain, also joined in for a selfie with Isha and Sana.

          Sanjay Gupta, known for directing films like Kaante, Jazbaa, and
          Kaabil, recently lent his support to director Sandeep Reddy Vanga amid
          the controversy surrounding his film, Animal. Sanjay commended
          Sandeep&apos;s conviction, noting that he has successfully unsettled
          many, contributing to the film&apos;s impact. Additionally, Sanjay
          expressed reservations about Javed Akhtar&apos;s criticism of Animal,
          suggesting that the veteran screenwriter views the world through a
          lens of nostalgia and is resistant to acknowledging societal changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a conversation with Siddharth Kannan on his YouTube channel,
          Sanjay praised Sandeep for disrupting the conventional narrative.
          &quot;He has made a lot of people very uncomfortable. We are the land
          of the Kamasutra and Khajuraho, and we still don&apos;t talk about sex
          education. We are inherently a hypocritical race,&quot; Sanjay
          remarked. He discussed a recent meeting with Anurag Kashyap and
          Vikramaditya Motwane, where they acknowledged that Animal had
          significantly impacted the film industry. &quot;Recently, I had gone
          for the trial of a film and there I met Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya
          Motwane, and a few others. Animal is all anyone can talk about right
          now. Now life is pre and post Animal,&quot; he said. Sanjay also
          mentioned that his upcoming script has been influenced by Animal,
          thinking about what Sandeep Vanga would do in certain scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanjay revealed that there were sequences in Animal reminiscent of his
          film Zinda, released in 2006 and starring Sanjay Dutt and John
          Abraham. Zinda, an unofficial adaptation of Oldboy, featured scenes
          similar to those found in Animal, specifically involving a hammer and
          a large-scale fight. &quot;There are sequences in Animal which we have
          shot in Zinda, almost 20 years ago in 2004. The exact same sequences,
          with the hammer and 30 people fighting,&quot; Sanjay disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding Javed Akhtar&apos;s criticism of Animal, Sanjay acknowledged
          that Javed might have a point but argued that he is viewing the world
          through &quot;rose-tinted glasses.&quot; According to Sanjay, Javed is
          reluctant to accept that society has evolved. &quot;He is not
          accepting that the society has already changed. We are not the same
          people we were 10 years ago. We don&apos;t have the same compassion.
          We don&apos;t have the same patience,&quot; Sanjay remarked. He
          pointed out the media manipulation and societal changes, emphasizing
          that blaming the film for societal issues or vice versa is not
          justified. At the 9th Ajanta-Ellora International Film Festival, Javed
          Akhtar had labeled Animal as &quot;dangerous&quot; and criticized its
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanjay also expressed support for Anurag Kashyap, who defended Sandeep
          Reddy Vanga publicly. &quot;Anurag is defending Vanga, and he is very
          right. He is saying criticize the film, not the filmmaker. In Animal,
          people have a problem with Sandeep Vanga,&quot; Sanjay said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite facing criticism for its violent and misogynistic content,
          Animal managed to surpass Rs 900 crore at the worldwide box office.
          The film&apos;s success highlighted the audience&apos;s willingness to
          engage with unconventional narratives.

          After a hiatus spanning 13 years, Kiran Rao has made a triumphant
          return to the director&apos;s chair with &quot;Laapataa Ladies,&quot;
          her latest project following the critically acclaimed &quot;Dhobi

          ex-husband and actor Aamir Khan along with Jyoti Deshpande, was
          unveiled on Wednesday. Leading roles in the film are portrayed by
          Pratibha Ranta, Sparsh Shrivastav, and Nitanshi Goel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set in the rural landscapes of India, &quot;Laapataa Ladies&quot;
          revolves around the captivating tale of two young brides inadvertently
          exchanged on a train. The trailer unfolds the story of Deepak Kumar,
          played by Sparsh Shrivastav, the groom on a frantic quest to find his
          real bride. Seeking assistance in his search, he encounters a police
          officer portrayed by Ravi Kishan. As the investigation progresses, the

          Hrithik Roshan&apos;s upcoming film &quot;Fighter&quot; has garnered
          widespread acclaim for his impressive look, revealed his trainer Kris
          Gethin. According to Gethin, Hrithik embarked on an intensive training
          regimen almost 5-6 months prior to the film&apos;s shoot, maintaining
          a demanding schedule that excluded any cheat days for several months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gethin, who has been Hrithik&apos;s trainer for over a decade,
          reminisced about the initial contact with the actor&apos;s team in
          2011. He admitted to not knowing much about Hrithik at the time but
          emphasized the special connection they formed when they met. Despite
          being 50 years old, Hrithik&apos;s physique for &quot;Fighter&quot;
          exhibited a remarkable ability to &quot;change and adapt like it did
          12-13 years ago,&quot; appearing as if his body hadn&apos;t aged.
          Gethin attributed this to Hrithik&apos;s unwavering focus on achieving
          a healthier body, emphasizing that prioritizing health naturally leads
          to aesthetic goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding Hrithik&apos;s disciplined diet, Gethin revealed that the
          actor abstains from consuming any &quot;bad food&quot; for extended
          periods. Even on cheat days, Hrithik indulges in larger portions of
          his usual &quot;clean food.&quot; Gethin recounted an incident during
          a New Year&apos;s trip to Dubai, where Hrithik retired to bed by 9:30
          pm instead of joining the festivities. The following morning, he was
          up and engaged in beach running by 6 am.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gethin also shared insights into his training sessions with Vicky
          Kaushal, describing him as a &quot;high achiever&quot; who approaches
          his work and workouts with utmost seriousness. Despite operating on
          minimal sleep due to hectic shoot schedules and workouts, Vicky&apos;s
          dedication is unwavering, and he has not complained about the
          demanding routine, according to Gethin.

          After earning acclaim for his role in Jiyen Krishnakumar&apos;s action
          thriller &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; last year, the Tamil actor Balaji
          Patturaj, more commonly known as RJ Balaji, is gearing up for his
          first release of 2024, titled &quot;Singapore Saloon.&quot; Directed
          by Gokul, this coming-of-age film features Meenakshi Chaudhary,
          Sathyaraj, and Lal in pivotal roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recently unveiled trailer provides a glimpse into the movie,
          showcasing the journey of a young man with aspirations of becoming an
          exceptional hairstylist, inspired by his grandfather&apos;s legacy.
          Described as &quot;the untold story of a barber with perseverance,
          endurance, and resilience,&quot; the film boasts special appearances
          by director Lokesh Kanagaraj and actor Jiiva.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an outsider with no industry connections prior to entering the
          cinema, Balaji adheres to a personal philosophy, treating his work as
          his calling card.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;For an outsider who has struggled to enter the industry, a
          couple of failures may end their chances. On the other hand, an
          insider can survive even after delivering ten flops in ten years and
          still have two films in hand in the eleventh year,&quot; he remarked
          during a conversation with Film Companion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on the industry dynamics, Balaji expressed his perspective.
          &quot;I watched Ananya Pandey&apos;s &apos;Kho Gaye Hum Kahan&apos; on
          Netflix. I thought she did a good job, but consider someone from
          outside getting such an opportunity after not having worked on notable
          films before. Since my radio days, I&apos;ve been taught to treat
          every segment as if it&apos;s my last. This philosophy guides my work
          on films; I give my best to secure future opportunities without having
          to ask for them,&quot; he explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussing the challenges faced by outsiders in the film industry,
          Balaji drew parallels with the unpredictable nature of politics.
          &quot;In cinema, much like in politics, they say there are no
          permanent friends. People are good to you as long as they think you
          are beneath them. Once you treat them as equals, they struggle to
          accept it. This holds true in every sphere. While I&apos;m not placing
          blame, people often find comfort in certain roles, making it
          challenging for them to accept changes in dynamics. However, I prefer
          to distance myself from those who hold such views,&quot; Balaji
          remarked.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Singapore Saloon&quot; is scheduled for release on January 25.

          Shruti Haasan is set to take the lead in &quot;Chennai Story,&quot; a
          collaborative venture between India and the UK, which was initially
          poised to feature Samantha Ruth Prabhu. According to Variety,
          Samantha&apos;s replacement by Shruti Haasan is attributed to
          undisclosed reasons, with speculation suggesting Samantha&apos;s
          withdrawal from the film due to her year-long sabbatical. The film, an
          adaptation of Timeri N. Murari&apos;s 2004 novel &quot;The
          Arrangements of Love,&quot; is directed by Philip John, a
          BFTA-nominated director renowned for his work on &quot;Downton
          Abbey.&quot; In the movie, Shruti Haasan will portray a private
          detective, and joining her in the cast is Viveik Kalra, known for
          &quot;Blinded By The Light.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Chennai Story&quot; unfolds as a coming-of-age drama centered
          around a detective in India. Although the narrative revolves around a
          Tamil detective, the film predominantly features English with numerous
          Tamil dialogues. Co-authored by Philip John and Sri Lankan
          actor-filmmaker Nimmi Harasgama, the film explores universal themes
          through the prism of an international collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressing her enthusiasm for the project, Shruti Haasan conveyed to
          Variety the personal significance of depicting the diversity and
          uniqueness of Chennai on a global platform. Hailing from Chennai
          herself, she emphasized the excitement of collaborating with Phil and
          contributing to the storytelling of global yet culturally grounded
          narratives through international partnerships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Produced by Guru Films (India), Ripple World Pictures (UK), and Wales
          Ie Ie Productions, &quot;Chennai Story&quot; has the support of the
          British Film Institute. This project marks Shruti Haasan&apos;s
          continued foray into international cinema, following her role in the
          British psychological thriller &quot;The Eye&quot; (2023), which
          premiered at the London Independent Film Festival and the Greek
          International Film Festival.

          Bejoy Nambiar, a former assistant of renowned director Mani Ratnam,
          has consistently ventured into films catering to both Tamil and Hindi
          markets, much like his mentor. Notably, Bejoy goes beyond the
          conventional approach of dubbing and often features distinct casts for
          the Tamil and Hindi versions of his films. This approach was evident
          in his third film, &quot;David,&quot; where Vikram and Jiiva led the
          Tamil version, while the Hindi rendition starred Neil Nitin Mukesh and
          Vinay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same strategy is being applied to his upcoming project,
          &quot;Por&quot; (titled &quot;Dange&quot; in Hindi). Arjun Das and
          Kalidas Jayaram will play the lead roles in the Tamil version, while
          Harshavardhan and Ehan Bhatt will replace them in the Hindi
          adaptation. The film is set against the backdrop of a college campus,
          depicting the conflicts between two rival factions while addressing
          significant social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the lead actors, the movie features acclaimed
          performers such as Sanjana Natarajan from &quot;Sarpatta
          Parambarai,&quot; TJ Bhanu of &quot;Vaazhl,&quot; and Nikita Dutta in
          pivotal roles. As of now, details about the film&apos;s music composer
          and release date are yet to be disclosed. The first-look posters, with
          their compelling tagline, have already generated anticipation and
          curiosity among the audience, making &quot;Por&quot; a film to watch
          out for in both Tamil and Hindi cinema circuits.

          Rick Harrison, star of the hit show Pawn Stars, spoke out against the

          fentanyl overdose at age 39.{" "}

        <p>
          &quot;Yes, I can confirm Adam died from a fentanyl overdose,&quot; the
          58-year-old Rick told the New York Post. &quot;The fentanyl crisis in
          this country must be taken more seriously. It seems it is just flowing
          over the borders and nothing is being done about it. We must do
          better.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Rick broke his silence on Instagram, posting a photo with Adam and
          writing &quot;You will always be in my heart! I love you Adam.&quot;
          The family previously said in a statement they were &quot;extremely
          saddened&quot; and asked for privacy to grieve Adam&apos;s tragic
          loss.{" "}

        <p>
          His death is being investigated by Las Vegas police. While Rick&apos;s
          older son Corey was featured on Pawn Stars, Adam notably never
          appeared on the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam&apos;s passing comes as drug overdose deaths surpassed 112,000
          nationwide in 2023 for the first time ever, per reports. The spike is
          driven by the synthetic opioid fentanyl flowing into the U.S. across
          borders.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts say substantive solutions will require complex, costly and
          time-intensive healthcare reforms, expanded access to housing and
          mental health programs, and improved border security. But so far,
          promises by politicians to stop fentanyl smuggling have lacked
          actionable plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          By speaking out, Rick Harrison aims to draw attention to the
          devastating human toll of the border crisis that claimed his own
          son&apos;s life. Adam&apos;s story underscores that behind the
          statistics are real families suffering immense loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Harrison family grieves privately, Rick hopes Adam&apos;s

          Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar was among the select few from Bollywood
          privileged to witness the historic inauguration at the Ram Mandir in
          Ayodhya on January 22nd. Speaking from Ayodhya, he described the
          incredible energy and euphoria amongst the crowds there.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhandarkar said the vibe was vibrant and the emotion of everyone
          present was on another level. He called it a remarkable moment for all
          Indians, especially when the temple doors finally opened and Ram Lalla
          was revealed. People were overwhelmed and unable to control their
          emotions, with many moved to tears according to the director.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the doors opened, Bhandarkar said the crowds erupted in chants of
          &quot;Jai Shree Ram&quot;, clapping and cheering at getting the first
          glimpse of the idol. He called the experience emotional and
          overwhelming for everyone present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 55-year-old felt honored and privileged to be among the few from
          Bollywood included in the historic event, alongside esteemed actors,
          cricketers, filmmakers and industrialists. He said witnessing the
          inauguration was a once in a lifetime moment that he couldn&apos;t
          miss for the world.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Having eagerly looked forward to it for weeks, Bhandarkar expressed
          joy at being part of the ceremony and said it was a surreal moment he
          would cherish his whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the filmmaker, the most memorable part of the event was
          when rose petals were showered by helicopters overhead. He said seeing
          Ram Lalla&apos;s inner sanctum open as everyone cried was incredible
          beyond words.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Bhandarkar couldn&apos;t meet Prime Minister Modi, he said the
          PM looked very happy, as did the entire Bollywood contingent present
          during the celebrations.{" "}
        </p>

          The director also shared a viral selfie with his Fashion co-star
          Kangana Ranaut, who he called a very good friend and talented actress.
          He said they talked and clicked pictures together while seated near
          each other at the ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Bhandarkar conveyed his awe at experiencing such a
          significant spiritual and cultural milestone for India first-hand. As
          one of the few Bollywood guests present, he described the inclusive
          atmosphere and shared emotional reaction that made it a once in a
          lifetime memory to cherish.

          Deepika Padukone has been noticeably absent from promotions for her
          upcoming film Fighter, including skipping the trailer launch event
          earlier this month. In a recent interview with Bollywood Hungama,
          director Siddharth Anand addressed the speculation around
          Deepika&apos;s lack of visibility and explained it is part of their
          promotional strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about Deepika&apos;s absence and the chatter about it on
          social media, Siddharth said people often make conjectures but this
          was a deliberate decision. He revealed Deepika was meant to attend the
          trailer launch but fell ill, and would now be &quot;everywhere&quot;
          in promotions from Tuesday onwards.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Siddharth emphasized that doing promotions for Fighter without Deepika
          made no sense. He said, &quot;Obviously we can&apos;t do without
          Deepika...Deepika and Hrithik&apos;s pair is one of the major
          highlights. As a filmmaker, seeing them together is hugely exciting so
          I can only imagine the audience is also waiting for it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the director, holding back on showing too much of Deepika
          and Hrithik before release was intentional. He wanted audiences to
          enjoy their chemistry and magic unfold on the big screen without
          reaching a saturation point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, some reports had claimed Deepika unfollowed Siddharth on
          Instagram, hinting at possible tensions. But the director clarified it
          was always the plan to have Deepika join promotions close to release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fighter stars Hrithik Roshan as Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania,
          Deepika Padukone as Squadron Leader Minal Rathore and Anil Kapoor as
          Group Captain Rakesh Jai Singh. It revolves around the elite Air
          Dragons unit and their internal and external battles.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-octane action film marks Deepika and Hrithik&apos;s first
          on-screen collaboration. It is also Deepika&apos;s third project with
          director Siddharth Anand after Bachna Ae Haseeno and Pathaan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          With two of Bollywood&apos;s biggest stars paired up for the first
          time, anticipation for Fighter is sky-high. Siddharth&apos;s comments
          indicate they plan to capitalize on that buzz with Deepika front and
          center of promotions in the final run-up to release. Her millions of
          fans will undoubtedly be glad to finally see their favorite star
          highlighting the film they&apos;ve eagerly awaited.

          Veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan shared photos on his blog from his
          visit to the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya for the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of
          Ram Lalla. He attended the special event on Monday before returning to
          Mumbai late at night.{" "}

        <p>
          The megastar posted pictures of the Ram Lalla deity inside the new
          temple, as well as exterior shots of the magnificent structure. He
          included a photo of himself with folded hands, seeking blessings on
          the spiritually significant occasion. Amitabh opted for traditional
          attire and a shawl for the ceremony.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Describing it as a day filled with divine relevance, he wrote “Back
          from the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at Ayodhya.” Amitabh was accompanied
          to Ayodhya by his son and fellow actor Abhishek Bachchan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          After the ceremony, Amitabh and Abhishek also met with Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Photos
          show Amitabh greeting CM Adityanath with folded hands and conversing,
          before Abhishek joined them. PM Modi also welcomed Amitabh with folded
          hands, which the screen icon returned respectfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Amitabh recently purchased a 10,000 square foot plot of
          land in Ayodhya, further showing his deep connection to the holy city.
          The registrar confirmed the ₹9 crore transaction for the property was
          completed, with Amitabh&apos;s lawyer executing the agreement on his
          behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the Bachchans, many other Bollywood celebrities like
          Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Anupam Kher, Kangana Ranaut, and Sonu Nigam
          attended the momentous Ram Mandir ceremony. With approximately 8,000
          invitees including 1,500 VIP guests, the event featured stunning
          visuals of army helicopters showering flowers on the new temple.

          The grand temple is seen as a testament to their unwavering faith and

          cannot be denied.{" "}

          The Sankranti 2023 box office results have surprised the Telugu film
          industry. The festival period usually sees a clash between big star
          releases vying for audience attention. This year, all eyes were on
          Mahesh Babu&apos;s &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, his collaboration with
          hitmaker Trivikram Srinivas after &apos;Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo&apos;.
          But a relatively smaller film, &apos;HanuMan&apos; starring Teja

          &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos; saw an upswing over the weekend but
          continued lagging behind &apos;HanuMan&apos;. On Day 9, it collected
          ₹3.25 crores domestically. Despite a jump in footfalls on Day 10, the
          film could only manage ₹3.50 crores. Its total now stands at ₹118
          crores. In contrast, &apos;HanuMan&apos; earned ₹14.6 crores on Day 9
          and a huge ₹16.50 crores on Day 10. Its domestic total has crossed
          ₹130 crores, far ahead of Mahesh Babu&apos;s film.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The other Sankranti releases - Nagarjuna&apos;s &apos;Naa Saami
          Ranga&apos; and Venkatesh&apos;s &apos;Sanidhav&apos; - have collected
          ₹26 crores and ₹14 crores respectively. Clearly, the underdog
          &apos;HanuMan&apos; has won over the audience.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This outcome has surprised many since Mahesh Babu typically has a huge
          fan following. The producer of &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, Naga Vamsi,
          acknowledged issues with the film&apos;s promotion. He said late night
          1am shows sent the wrong signal for a family entertainer unlike an
          action film. Release strategies need to suit the genre, he admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics have pointed to the film&apos;s predictable storyline and lack
          of freshness as reasons for the lukewarm response.
          &apos;HanuMan&apos;, in contrast, garnered praise for its novel
          superhero premise and CGI effects. Word-of-mouth has been a key factor
          in its rise.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sankranti battle shows the power of content over star power. For
          veteran stars like Mahesh Babu, their brand value can drive openings
          but the film needs to offer more. Underdog films can triumph with
          unique and compelling stories. Perhaps Telugu cinema is maturing
          towards scripts mattering as much as scales and stars.

          The recently released biopic &apos;Main Atal Hoon&apos; starring
          Pankaj Tripathi as former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had a
          slow start at the box office despite the lead actor&apos;s popularity.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The film earned only Rs 1.15 crore on its opening day, Friday. But it
          picked up pace over the weekend, collecting Rs 2.1 crore on Saturday
          and an estimated Rs 2.40 crore on Sunday. This takes its total
          domestic box office earnings so far to around Rs 5.65 crore. The film
          recorded a 15.81% Hindi occupancy on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by National Award winner Ravi Jadhav, &apos;Main Atal
          Hoon&apos; is co-written by Jadhav and Rishi Virmani. The cast
          includes Pankaj Tripathi in the lead along with Piyush Mishra, Raja
          Rameshkumar Sevak, Daya Shankar Pandey, Payal Nair, Paula McGlynn and
          Gauri Sukhtankar.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite Pankaj Tripathi&apos;s strong performance, the film has
          received mixed reviews from critics so far. Film critic Shubhra Gupta
          of Indian Express gave it 2 stars. She praised Tripathi as &quot;born
          to play this part&quot; with his command over Hindi and speech rhythms
          being &quot;so hypnotic.&quot;{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she felt even an actor of Tripathi&apos;s caliber could not
          do much with such a reductive script. She remarked that instead of a
          rounded portrait, what we get is a narrative of Vajpayee as a budding
          politician who shaped the Jan Sangh, Janata Party and the current BJP.
        </p>
        <p>
          More positive reviews highlighted Tripathi&apos;s brilliant mimicry
          and how he compellingly captured Vajpayee&apos;s mannerisms. But many
          agreed the script tended to hero-worship Vajpayee rather than
          critically analyze his lengthy political journey.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The mixed response indicates that while Indian audiences are eager for
          more political biopics, there is also greater demand now for nuanced
          storytelling rather than hagiographies. For &apos;Main Atal Hoon&apos;
          to pick up pace at the box office, it may need strong word of mouth
          based on Tripathi&apos;s performance.

          Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has recently disclosed how a stunt accident on
          the sets of his 2013 Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chennai Express brought
          back traumatic memories of a fatal mishap under his late father MB
          Shetty&apos;s supervision in the 1980 film Bombay 405 Miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Bombay 405 Miles, featuring Shatrughan Sinha, MB Shetty was the
          action director. Sinha&apos;s body double Mansoor had to jump from a
          warehouse as part of a stunt sequence involving a huge blast.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview, Rohit Shetty recounted how during the shoot, due to
          chaos and confusion, the blast operator and camera operator had
          inadvertently switched positions unbeknownst to Shetty. So when
          Mansoor jumped, Shetty signaled the blast technician assuming he was
          the cameraman. The warehouse exploded with Mansoor inside, leading to
          his demise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty was a child then and only heard about the horrific accident in
          the evening. A year later, his father passed away as well, overcome by
          guilt over the incident. Though MB Shetty had a strong reputation
          among industry folks, this tragedy weighed heavily on him. He turned
          to alcoholism, withdrew from work and remained homebound before his
          death. The family understood his suffering led to his premature demise
          – destiny&apos;s cruelty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty then described a controlled car blast scene in Chennai Express.
          Though his team removes fuel tanks for such stunts, some petrol had
          spilled on the chassis while prepping. Unbeknownst to them, the
          imported car had a reserve tank. After filming the scene, a spark
          reignited the splattered petrol, engulfing the car in flames with
          veteran stuntman Shankar Anna inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          They panicked as the flaming, overturned car trapped Shankar inside.
          Fortunately fire brigades on standby doused the flames, broke the
          glass and rescued him with minor burns. The chilling parallel to his
          father&apos;s long-ago accident shook Shetty deeply before he gathered
          himself and rushed Shankar to the hospital. He has fully recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interview, Shetty called his mother Ratna a &quot;fighter&quot;
          who raised him and his sister through immense hardship after his
          father&apos;s death. Despite struggles and poverty, she shielded them
          from sadness and nurtured a stoic work ethic. To support the family,
          she resumed stunt doubling for stars, having met MB Shetty through
          this work. If you notice the top-angle shots in Andaaz song Zindagi Ek
          Safar, Ratna is the one sitting there!
        </p>
        <p>
          After Shetty started working, Ratna stopped and their fortunes
          changed. But he inherited her grit to face challenges head-on. Shetty
          feels that as long as there is work, there is hope. He remains
          eternally grateful to his mother for shielding him throughout the
          decade-long adversity after his father&apos;s passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The director has now made his streaming debut with the Prime Video
          series Indian Police Force starring Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi
          and Shilpa Shetty.

          With his first foray into the OTT space, filmmaker Rohit Shetty brings
          his signature crash-bang formulaic cop drama to the streaming universe
          with &apos;Indian Police Force&apos;. Teaming up with co-director
          Sushwanth Prakash, Shetty packs the 7-episode show with the
          over-the-top tropes and tactics seen in his box office hit franchises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans of the director&apos;s &apos;Singham&apos; and &apos;Simmba&apos;
          films won&apos;t find surprises here. The series stays squarely in
          Shetty&apos;s wheelhouse, cramming in evil Muslim terrorists countered
          by valiant Muslim officers, contrived plots threatening innocents, and
          vehicles spinning wildly through the air. Romantic song interludes
          between the lead pair stretch the runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          References to his previous cop heroes Singham and Simmba reinforce
          we&apos;re in familiar territory, transplanted to Delhi though largely
          realized through obvious CGI landmarks. It&apos;s a greatest hits of
          elements from Shetty&apos;s cinematic cop sagas, now extended into an
          episodic streaming iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his heavy-hitter lead stars Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn and Ranveer
          Singh unavailable, Shetty casts Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi and
          Shilpa Shetty as the khaki-clad officers. They sport the mandatory
          sculpted midriffs and tough guy Ray-Ban glares synonymous with the
          director&apos;s testosterone-fueled style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vivek Oberoi is compelling but underutilized as the washed-up
          inspector reinstated for one last case. Sidharth Malhotra&apos;s
          wide-eyed sincerity sits oddly with the brute force his character
          employs. But Shilpa Shetty seems to relish playing the badass officer
          known simply by her surname, getting in on the kicking and punching
          action. Here&apos;s hoping she sees more of that in a likely second
          season.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the freedom of streaming, Shetty delivers his signature bells and
          whistles without the price of a theater ticket. Logic, nuance and
          detail are beside the point in this turbo-charged spectacle. The
          director&apos;s steadfast formula marches on, now reaching fans&apos;
          screens at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; relies on familiar devices like
          misdirection and sleight of hand rather than air-tight plotting to
          propel its thin story. The cast is decorative, tasked with modeling
          police apparel and dodging explosions rather than embodying
          characters. Fans seeking high-octane stunts and mindless entertainment
          will get their fill.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those expecting evolution or innovation in Shetty&apos;s
          storytelling may be disappointed. The show brings his high-decibel cop
          anthems to OTT largely unchanged. For devotees of the director&apos;s
          campy maximalism, it&apos;s a familiar fast food fix now delivered via
          streaming. With a captive audience at home, seasoning is optional when
          serving more of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The debut season amounts to an all-you-can-eat Rohit Shetty cop drama
          buffet. Logical restraint and nuance won&apos;t be on the menu. But
          stunts will be super-sized along with the pyrotechnics. So viewers
          craving adventures in Shetty&apos;s OTT universe can have their
          expectations met by this platter of the director&apos;s greatest hits.
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; offers a tried and tested sensory
          overload feast for fans seeking familiar flavor.

          Rumors of an engagement between Telugu film stars Vijay Deverakonda
          and Rashmika Mandanna have resurfaced, with some reports even
          speculating a February wedding. However, Vijay has categorically
          denied these latest rumors in a recent interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing the claims, Vijay remarked, &quot;I&apos;m not getting
          engaged or married in February.&quot; He added, seemingly weary of the
          recurring speculation, &quot;It feels like the press just wants to get
          me married every two years. I hear this rumor every year.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vijay and Rashmika first sparked relationship speculation after
          starring together in the 2018 Telugu hit Geetha Govindam, later
          reteaming for the 2019 film Dear Comrade. While not publicly
          confirming their status, the two have been spotted together on
          multiple occasions over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, they were seen vacationing at a beach resort in the
          Maldives. More recently, the supposed couple was photographed
          holidaying in Vietnam, fueling rumors they are now living together and
          may formalize their relationship soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professionally, both actors have been riding high. Rashmika is basking
          in the success of Animal with Ranbir Kapoor, and will next be seen in
          the eagerly awaited sequel Pushpa 2: The Rule alongside Allu Arjun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Vijay starred opposite Samantha Ruth Prabhu in this
          year&apos;s Tamil rom-com Khushi. He has the upcoming Telugu films
          Family Star and VD12 with director Gowtam Tinnanuri in the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while their admirers may be willing it, Vijay has quashed the
          latest gossip about an engagement or wedding with Rashmika. However,
          the tight-lipped co-stars continue to remain coy about the true nature
          of their bond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time will tell whether the patterns of the past repeat, with more
          joint vacations and sightings further fueling rumors of romance. For
          now though, Vijay asserts the February wedding chatter holds no water.

          Wilde - an unconventional free spirit who refuses to bow to societal

          Orry, the internet personality, is the modern day equivalent of Oscar
          Wilde - an unconventional free spirit who refuses to bow to societal
          pressures and norms. His recent conversation with Karan Johar evoked
          parallels to Wilde&apos;s controversial trial for homosexuality in
          1895.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Wilde, Orry represents a bold rejection of convention and an
          unapologetic commitment to self-expression. Where Wilde faced
          hostility for his sexuality and bohemian lifestyle in Victorian
          England, Orry draws ire today for shunning expectations of how
          celebrities should behave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both serve as a mirror that reflects the discomfiting truths about
          societal prejudice. Their disregard for norms enrages the
          &apos;incalculably stupid brutes and illiterates&apos; unable to
          appreciate their artistry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wilde was prosecuted by the Marquess of Queensberry, who abhorred the
          playwright&apos;s affairs with his son. Despite friends counseling
          prudence, an indignant Wilde sued the Marquess for libel over a note
          calling him a &quot;posing sodomite.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What followed was a ruthless trial by media aiming to prove
          Wilde&apos;s homosexuality. His Dublin acquaintance Edward Carson
          ruthlessly cross-examined him, despising Wilde for consorting with
          lower classes. When asked about the morality of art, Wilde famously
          replied works of art are simply good or bad, not moral or immoral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, those mocking Orry fail to recognize art and thought when
          confronted by it. Like Wilde, Orry lives in &apos;incalculably stupid
          times&apos; too blinkered to appreciate true originality.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Bertrand Russell noted, conventional minds rage at nonconformity
          because they see it as criticism of themselves. Orry draws ire for not
          obeying the usual star rules. Unlike nepotistic actors ruining
          classics, he embraces life as his own film, liberated from PR diktats.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spurns industry rituals and misogynistic tropes masquerading as
          cinema. Unlike reclusive creators like Harper Lee, Orry actively
          engages the world on his own terms. His autonomy threatens
          establishments invested in compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The philosopher Ramadhir Singh observed people inhabit personal dream
          worlds. Orry has transcended this limitation to seamlessly merge his
          inner life and outward persona. His self-actualization elicits anger
          from those unable to achieve this liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Wilde, Orry represents the timeless struggle between convention
          and creativity, tradition and novelty, repression and rebellion. Both
          expose society&apos;s tendency to vilify nonconformists exposing
          suppressed truths. They pay a price for providing that mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          But visionaries who reject the familiar for fresh horizons often must
          withstand hostility from blinkered minds. Art that challenges
          orthodoxies inevitably provokes backlash. However, daring spirits like
          Orry and Wilde also open the door to progress and new possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though differing in context, Orry and Wilde&apos;s journeys highlight
          the burdens born by those rejecting the beaten path. Convention exerts
          a powerful pull that visionaries must overcome. Both inspire kindred
          spirits to live courageously, even if it draws ridicule from the
          &apos;incalculably stupid&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          By boldly pursuing self-expression over conformity, they light the way
          for future generations to actualize their inner cinema, unencumbered
          by others’ limited perceptions. Orry, like Wilde, represents the
          eternally alluring promise of fearlessly being oneself.

          The new Netflix true crime documentary American Nightmare transcends
          the usual reductive tropes of the genre to deliver a piercing critique
          of flawed policing, everyday sexism, and ultimately, a moving love
          story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Created by the talented team behind The Tinder Swindler, American
          Nightmare revisits a brief media frenzy from 2015 that drew
          comparisons to Gone Girl. Young blonde woman Denise Huskins was
          reported missing by her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, who claimed they were
          attacked by masked intruders who kidnapped Denise after binding and
          sedating him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cops immediately suspected Aaron was lying. Why would anyone
          kidnap Denise? Why demand a measly $15,000 ransom? And didn&apos;t
          Aaron confess to emotionally cheating on Denise because he wanted his
          ex back? Sensing Gone Girl vibes, the police zeroed in on Aaron as the
          prime suspect, threatening to label him a &quot;monster.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The case exploded when Denise suddenly reappeared at her family home
          48 hours after vanishing, traumatized and needing time to process her
          ordeal before talking to police. But the cops refused, convinced this
          was an elaborate hoax. Mere hours after Denise&apos;s return, they
          held a press conference accusing her of wasting resources on a wild
          goose chase.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare intricately recounts events through extensive
          interviews with Aaron and Denise, interrogation footage, lawyer
          inputs, and a journalist who covered the saga. The filmmakers
          skillfully cherry pick key moments to spin an engaging story while
          assuming viewer unfamiliarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the most impressive aspect is the even-handed tone taken on this
          complex case. The procedural route or salacious angle were obvious
          options passed over. Instead, American Nightmare is a remarkably
          level-headed exploration of a real-life tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s astonishing how gracefully Denise and Aaron handled the
          media maelstrom. The show calls out prejudiced press coverage and a
          gullible public ever-eager to anoint new villains just to feel morally
          superior. Even Gone Girl&apos;s Amazing Amy didn&apos;t suffer this
          degree of indignity, and she was an actual criminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the investigation proceeds, the couple&apos;s version of events
          checks out. The meticulous methodology and odd ransom demand point to
          a sophisticated extortion ring later uncovered. But the damage was
          done. Aaron&apos;s reputation and career were left in tatters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through extensive interviews, Denise and Aaron&apos;s incredible bond
          emerges, stronger than ever. We learn of Aaron&apos;s protective
          nature, traced back to his firefighter father&apos;s emphasis on
          serving others. Despite law enforcement&apos;s betrayal, the couple
          displays uncommon grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviews with willful investigators unwilling to admit mistakes
          reveal deep systemic flaws in policing - confirmation bias, sloppy
          detection, and macho posturing supersede the truth. The press comes
          off even worse, salivating for a juicy &apos;he did it&apos; plot
          instead of waiting for facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare ultimately transcends genre by training its focus
          on flawed institutions and everyday misogyny rather than
          sensationalism. An impeccably crafted, morally grounded piece, it
          serves as an inspiring example of two ordinary people displayed
          uncommon courage under fire.

          slated for release on Netflix on February 9th.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhumi unveiled the intense teaser on social media, describing it as
          the story of a committed journalist who perseveres to uncover the
          truth no matter what. Bhakshak is inspired by real life events that
          took place in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teaser provides a glimpse of Bhumi portraying the role of Vaishali
          Singh, a determined investigative journalist seeking to expose a
          horrific crime and shed light on the dismal reality of violence
          against women in society. Commenting on the film&apos;s hard-hitting
          theme, the director expressed that the aim is to highlight difficult
          realities and generate meaningful conversations that can lead to
          positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaurav Verma, producer at Red Chillies Entertainment, conveyed that
          they believe in storytelling that not only engages audiences but also
          enlightens them. He described Bhakshak as a testimony to their
          commitment to thought-provoking narratives that encourage social
          reflections. They are excited to partner with Netflix to share this
          impactful story with global audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruchikaa Kapoor Sheikh from Netflix India added that Bhakshak is an
          intense story following a resolute journalist&apos;s unfaltering
          pursuit of justice against all obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helmed by director Pulkit, Bhakshak also features impressive
          performances by Sanjay Mishra, Aditya Srivastava and Sai Tamhankar
          essaying pivotal roles. But Bhumi takes centerstage in her portrayal
          of the fierce journalist at the heart of this hard-hitting story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set to premiere exclusively on Netflix on February 9th, the promising
          investigative drama marks another career defining performance by Bhumi
          Pednekar in the central role.

          According to the IMDb synopsis, the film revolves around a couple in

          However, the director, Maruthi, clarified the situation with a playful

          This statement makes it clear that the plot mentioned on IMDb is not
          the current focus of Prabhas and Maruthi&apos;s collaboration. Similar
          to many high-budget projects, the details of the film&apos;s storyline
          are likely to remain under wraps until the trailer is released, which
          might take some time.

          was in the song. I was waiting for the shot when I saw Amitabh
          Bachchan saying my dialogue instead. I thought, ‘Amitabh is saying my
          dialogue. My career is over.’ I assumed as a star he could do
          anything. He took my dialogue. I went to the director and complained
          ‘this is not fair.’ All six actors were sitting behind a bush watching
          me cry and started clapping saying, ‘We’re joking with you.’ The
          camera wasn’t rolling. They thought Shakti Kapoor is so serious about
          his scenes and dialogues, let’s prank him. Amitabh then told the
          director to give me 3-4 more shots saying ‘He will die otherwise.’”
        </p>
        <p>
          Satte Pe Satta, released in 1982, is a Hindi action comedy film
          directed by Raj N Sippy and produced by Romu N Sippy. Starring Amitabh
          Bachchan, Hema Malini, Amjad Khan and others, it revolves around seven
          unsophisticated brothers who are civilized by Indu (Malini), wife of
          the eldest Ravi Anand (Bachchan). The plot takes a twist when Ravi’s
          lookalike Babu is ordered by cunning uncle Ranjit Singh (Khan) to
          murder disabled heiress Seema Singh (Ranjeeta Kaur). Adapted from
          Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), it is regarded as a Bollywood
          classic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behind-the-scenes anecdote provides insight into Shakti
          Kapoor&apos;s dedication and insecurity as a character actor sharing
          screen space with superstar Amitabh Bachchan. It also showcases the
          playful camaraderie between co-stars on set. The prank indicates that
          Shakti was initially perceived as an overly earnest performer by his
          co-stars, who decided to pull his leg.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Amitabh ensuring additional shots for Shakti afterwards
          demonstrates his graciousness and professional courtesy towards a
          co-actor. Overall, the incident provides a humorous glimpse into the
          personalities and equations between some of Bollywood&apos;s biggest
          stars in their prime decades ago, especially the towering impact of an
          icon like Bachchan. It adds another memorable moment to the rich
          nostalgia surrounding an all-time classic like Satte Pe Satta nearly
          four decades later.

          Actor Shehnaaz Gill made heads turn in a glitzy gold bustier blouse
          paired with a shimmering black sequin saree by designer Gaurav Gupta.
          She wore the striking cocktail-perfect ensemble to Ira Khan and Nupur
          Shikhare&apos;s star-studded wedding reception in Mumbai. While other
          celeb guests opted for traditional ethnic looks, Shehnaaz&apos;s
          modern saree twist was perfect for fashion-forward Indian women. Her
          gold bustier and embellished saree made for the ultimate party outfit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz shared photos of herself dressed in the Gaurav Gupta gold top
          and black sequin saree on Instagram. &quot;Gold & Glitter,&quot; she
          aptly captioned the post, earning praise from fans calling her a
          &quot;Golden Diva&quot; and &quot;Golden Girl of India.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The pre-draped saree featured dazzling gold diamantes embellishing the
          entire front, a ruffled pallu split into three floor-sweeping trains,
          ruffled pleats, ankle-grazing hem, and a figure-hugging cinched
          silhouette. She paired it with a gold bustier blouse having broad
          straps, shimmery beaded work, fitted bodice, plunging sweetheart
          neckline with front slit, and a curved super-cropped hem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping accessories minimal, Shehnaaz wore just a dainty gold bracelet
          and heels. Her glam picks included winged black eyeliner, golden eye
          shadow, feathered brows, glossy caramel lips, blushed cheeks, and
          highlighted contours. Flowing center-parted locks styled in
          well-defined curls completed her party-perfect look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz was last seen in the 2022 film Thank You For Coming, starring
          alongside Bhumi Pednekar, Dolly Singh, Kusha Kapila and Shibani Bedi.
          The movie also premiered at the 46th Toronto International Film
          Festival (TIFF) in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor frequently makes best-dressed lists for her experimental
          fashion choices spanning ethnic, fusion, casual and glamorous looks.
          Be it sarees, lehengas, gowns or corset designs, Shehnaaz carries both
          Indian and Western ensembles with flair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gold and black sequin Gaurav Gupta number gave a glitzy upgrade to
          the traditional saree. The sensual bustier styling with a saree draped
          around the waist created an alluring Indo-Western vibe. The
          embellished fabric, sultry palette and figure-hugging silhouette made
          it perfect for cocktail nights or receptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz proved sequins can work beautifully for evening ethnic wear,
          beyond just plain silks or chiffons. Her outfit gave inspiration for
          modern Indian women who want to give the saree a sexy twist. The
          plunging neckline, strappy sleeves, sequin work and cropped pallu gave
          traditional drapes a contemporary makeover.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor showed how fusion pairings like the bustier-saree can add
          drama and oomph for wedding functions and parties. While the black and
          gold color scheme lent a classical elegance, the shimmery
          embellishments and sensual styling gave it a glamorous edge.
          Shehnaaz&apos;s red carpet-worthy ensemble exemplified her
          experimental and confident sense of style.

              viral moment à la Selena Gomez at the Globes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earlier, Donna had said she would be in the heated skybox despite

              have to have a blanket and I’ll have my winter coat on,&quot; she
              stated. This was Swift&apos;s 5th Chiefs game out of 6 at

              went to that first game, we were a couple.&quot; Swift added they

        <p>
          Sharad Kelkar, one of the most recognizable voices in Bollywood,
          recently discussed his experiences dubbing for South Indian films. He
          is known for voicing Prabhas&apos; characters in the Hindi dubbed
          versions of films like Baahubali and Salaar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar shared that he used to stammer as a child and never imagined he
          would become an actor or voice actor. On dubbing for South films, he
          said the recognition he got for voicing Prabhas was immense, unlike
          anything seen before in the voicing industry. He noted how audiences
          now notice the voice artists, like Shreyas Talpade in Pushpa and
          Sachin Gole for Yash in KGF.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Kelkar, Baahubali brought about this change and made
          people recognize and respect voice actors. He wants filmmakers to
          start crediting voice actors in movie posters and end credits, like
          it&apos;s done in Hollywood animated films. He feels voice actors in
          India don&apos;t get their due.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussing overcoming his stammering, Kelkar shared that correcting
          his breathing pattern helped stop his stammering. People started
          noticing his voice after that. To improve his voice modulation, he
          observed other actors&apos; dialogue delivery. Once the stammering
          reduced, he learned the craft of dubbing from coach Mona Shetty.
          Starting with small projects, his big break was Baahubali.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar&apos;s next voice acting project is Hotstar&apos;s animated
          series The Legend of Hanuman, where he has voiced Ravana. He chooses
          projects based on the writing. He wanted to break the cliche and
          present a new perspective on Ravana. As an actor, voicing mythological
          characters allows exploring them in new ways. Overall, Kelkar wants
          writers to get more recognition in India for their critical
          contribution.

          4.5 crore gross, Tamil Nadu with Rs 0.5 crore and Rs 0.5 crore from
          other parts of India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other major release this Friday was Teja Sajja and director
          Prasanth Varma’s pan-India sci-fi fantasy ‘HanuMan’. Despite positive
          reviews, the film had a more subdued opening day compared to ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’. The total day one net collection for ‘HanuMan’ across all
          languages was Rs 7.56 crore as per estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this, the majority Rs 5.5 crore net came from the Telugu version.
          The Hindi dubbed version contributed Rs 2 crore, while other languages
          chipped in with Rs 0.06 crore. However, the unique genre and
          word-of-mouth are expected to attract the family audience, especially
          in the Hindi belt where there is a dearth of major releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first weekend remains crucial for both ‘Guntur Kaaram’ and
          ‘HanuMan’ as the Sankranti weekend will see other big Telugu releases
          like Venkatesh’s ‘Saindhav’ and Nagarjuna’s ‘NaanSamruddha’ competing
          for screens and audiences. Trade pundits had predicted Mahesh Babu’s
          film will dominate over the Sankranti releases due to his stardom. It
          remains to be seen if the box office dynamics change as more films
          open.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Trivikram Srinivas, known for several blockbusters, ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’ marks an attempt to deliver a hit after his previous film ‘Ala
          Vaikunthapurramuloo’. Mahesh Babu was last seen in the 2020
          blockbuster ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’. Hence, the combination of the star
          actor and popular director has generated immense buzz among fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Guntur Kaaram’ features Mahesh Babu in the role of an archaeologist
          on a treasure hunt. Pooja Hegde stars as the female lead, while the
          cast includes Jayaram, Sachin Khedekar, and others. The story blends
          comedy, adventure, and supernatural elements against the backdrop of
          Guntur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film’s release in theaters coinciding with the Sankranti festival
          weekend gives it the advantage of attracting big crowds. Moreover,
          Mahesh Babu has a huge fan following across the Telugu states who
          eagerly await his films on the big screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Covid pandemic impacting the entertainment industry over the
          past two years, the response to ‘Guntur Kaaram’ indicates that
          audiences are flocking back to theaters when major stars like Mahesh
          Babu deliver a promising film.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the film sustains its collections over the extended opening week
          and positive word-of-mouth, it is headed towards becoming a huge hit.
          Not just in the Telugu belt, but even markets like Karnataka, Tamil
          Nadu, and Hindi circuits hold potential if content clicks with a wide
          appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Telugu film industry, the success of ‘Guntur Kaaram’ will
          provide a major boost after a difficult pandemic period. And for
          Mahesh Babu, it will cement his standing as one of Tollywood’s most
          bankable superstars with an enviable box office track record.

          In the latest eviction twist, contestant Samarth Jurel has reportedly
          been eliminated from the popular reality show Bigg Boss 17 just ahead
          of the grand finale this month.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Bigg Boss 17 approaches its finale episode, the show is currently

          ones. However, an exciting update has now emerged regarding the
          weekend eviction that has brought immense joy to many fans.

          Not only has the movie persevered through the ten new Netflix releases

          Reunited in the Bengali film industry, Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad

          Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee expressed their thoughts on the

          deeply appreciative of the tremendously positive reception to Shastry

          of family dynamics.&quot;

        <p>
          It&apos;s encouraging to see how the story&apos;s universal themes,

          forces that mold our lives, resonate with viewers.

          The film&apos;s astounding success expands the director duo&apos;s
          already impressive body of work. Their most recent release,
          &quot;Raktabeej,&quot; which was made by Windows Productions, ended up

          We know that when two exceptionally talented people like Konkona
          Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee collaborate, the bar will be set
          extremely high. Thus, it is understandable that director Abhishek
          Chaubey is under pressure for the Netflix web series &quot;Killer
          Soup.&quot; It is &apos;very very loosely based on real-life
          events&apos;, as the makers claimed. So is this soup really as
          delicious as it sounds, or do the masalas go too far in this case?
          Let&apos;s investigate!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Konkona Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee film gets off to a great
          start. It centers on Manoj Bajpayee as Prabhakar, also known as Prabhu
          Shetty, and his spouse, Konkona Sensharma, as Swathi Shetty. Although
          Prabhu has been using his brother Arvind (Shayaji Shinde) as a means
          of money laundering, Swathi is solely concerned with refining her paya
          soup, which doesn&apos;t seem to be popular, and starting her own
          restaurant. Another character in the play is Umesh Pillai (played by
          Manoj Bajpayee again), who serves as both Swathi&apos;s paramour and
          Prabhu&apos;s masseuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          It starts out one way and then gets messy and complicated from there.
          Things happen (let&apos;s just settle for that, since saying anything
          more would give away the ending). What would this all lead to, and
          would Swathi be able to escape the scandal of money laundering and
          start her own restaurant? The program focuses on that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The series&apos; first two episodes are packed full of action.
          Actually, it seemed like everything was happening in these two
          episodes, so viewers&apos; biggest curiosity was what would be covered
          in the remaining six!
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the show doesn&apos;t get particularly dark, there are a number
          of twists and turns as the plot develops, leaving the audience curious
          about what will happen next. By the halfway point of the program, one
          could only wonder what more Chaubey could provide!
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s not necessarily a good thing. The show felt strained even
          after four episodes, and there were still roughly three hours and
          twenty minutes of content to cover. This made it unclear whether
          Chaubey would be able to maintain the momentum he had established. As
          a matter of fact, the third episode marks the slowdown in pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that everyone was nervous about what would happen next in the
          dark comedy is evidence that it is a skillfully written thriller. But
          there was a strange urgency about it. Chaubey&apos;s trademark
          eccentricity is present, though it doesn&apos;t always fully connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Konkana Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee are superb actors who also
          give faultless performances in &quot;Killer Soup.&quot; Still, there
          was a gap between the two; at least in the first four episodes, there
          was never much of a spark.
        </p>
        <p>
          The performers play their roles almost flawlessly, despite the fact
          that some characters—like the Khansama who has been teaching Swathi
          how to cook—are wildly exaggerated. Particularly striking was
          Nasser&apos;s portrayal of Hassan, a man driven by a personal tragedy
          to learn the truth about the events surrounding him.
        </p>
        <p>
          One noteworthy aspect of the show is how masterfully it has been shot.
          The story is given so much depth (and the soup&apos;s flavor) by the
          close-up shots. Because of the actors&apos; talent and ability to
          convey the right emotions to maximize impact, it only gets better.

          One of Mrunal Thakur&apos;s stories opens in a Mumbai hotel&apos;s
          restroom. The actor ran into a journalist colleague a few days prior
          to the release of her first movie, Love Sonia, in 2018 following a
          busy afternoon of media appearances. Even though Mrunal was already
          well-known from television, he admitted that he was anxious to move
          from television to the big screen, particularly with a strange film.
          She could have waited for a more secure solution, but the movie
          &quot;spoke&quot; to her, she claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is simple to chart the rise of Mrunal Thakur, the Marathi mulgi who
          has created a Telugu storm by following her heart even when it goes
          against industry conventions, six years and twelve films later.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a quiet but heartfelt diversion from labelling every new breakout
          female performer as its next big thing, the internet is presently
          raving about what Mrunal has accomplished in her latest Telugu
          romantic drama, Hi Nanna. The star of Shouryu&apos;s directorial
          debut, Hi Nanna (Hi Papa in Hindi), is Nani, whose resume is filled
          with successful performances in the genre. However, Mrunal&apos;s
          performance, which is genuinely endearing, anchors a large portion of
          the movie and keeps it cohesive even when the writing becomes forced,
          the climax is pushed, and an unnecessary dance number makes an
          appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          She debuted in an international feature film with good intentions,
          acted opposite Hrithik Roshan in her first mainstream Hindi movie, and
          then struggled with earnest but unsatisfactory projects before
          becoming a more formidable actor in Telugu films, which are in a
          language she wasn&apos;t born in. It is unfortunate that none of
          Mrunal&apos;s feature films in Hindi, even those directed by
          well-known names, have been able to provide her with the same platform
          and star presentation that her two Telugu releases, Hi Nanna and Sita
          Ramam, have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the camera adorses Mrunal in Sita Ramam and Hi Nanna makes it
          hard to look away. She joins the frame fifty minutes into the love
          drama in the former. A train coupe door gently opens as the
          compartment emerges from the shadows of a tunnel and Dulquer
          Salmaan&apos;s voice-over creates a legendary buzz about the woman he
          is going to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar scenes involving Mrunal and Nani enjoying a lovely moment on a
          Goa beach can also be found in Hi Nanna, where she has an almost
          hair-flip entrance scene. Without giving anything away, he is telling
          her what his wife looked like. The scene is made possible not only by
          Nani&apos;s performance, the dialogue, or the melodious background
          music, but also by Mrunal, who never stops gazing lovingly at him and
          allowing her eyes to be the only ones that speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is what sets her two South releases apart from a gaze trap
          that other actors have fallen victim to in the past. Although it may
          be a derogatory term, a lot of actors have previously allowed
          themselves to be reduced to something as simple as a
          &quot;flowerpot.&quot; These kinds of roles are astounding because
          they bring about enormous popularity and a devoted following. However,
          as history has shown us in a variety of industries, if one
          doesn&apos;t step outside of their comfort zone, the outcome is always
          the same: they begin to be replaced by the newest person, who is given
          the responsibility for such stock roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Female actors have rarely been given anything appetizing to chew on in
          A-list star vehicles, particularly in Tamil and Telugu. The women
          exist in the plot because the men do. However, that has been carefully
          avoided by Mrunal&apos;s decisions so far. Despite the fact that the
          stories are told from the perspectives of the men, the genre of
          romantic dramas, which includes both of her Telugu films, guarantees
          women substantially greater agency and narrative control. The women
          that Mrunal has in Sita Ramam as well as in Hi Nanna are necessary for
          the men to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrunal made an expected choice in her second Telugu film, the poignant
          and sensitive Hi Nanna. The actor had previously discussed how
          challenging it was to navigate her career after Sita Ramam. She said
          &quot;Indeed, it is difficult. There was a period of time when I
          signed no Telugu films at all. For me, having faith in a character and
          a story was crucial. After a year, I signed Hi Nanna because I thought
          the movie was great and I could relate to it. What&apos;s the point if
          I don&apos;t spend those 100 days anticipating something?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s not like Hi Nanna is a perfect movie; it has its share of
          flaws. It&apos;s overly sweet and rides on a resolute, almost
          optimistic sentimentality, but in the end, it all comes together
          because the movie is still largely sincere and gives Mrunal at least
          two memorable scenes to show off her range. Similar to Sita Ramam,
          particularly in the film&apos;s finale, Mrunal excels in the
          movie&apos;s slower moments, which appropriately heightens its intense
          emotional beats. Her roles have essentially proved that, despite
          Bollywood&apos;s lack of interest, the actor is capable of producing
          endearing dramas. Mrunal Thakur demonstrates that she represents the
          flower, not the flowerpot, with the help of Sita Ramam and Hi Nanna.

          Miller was unveiled Saturday, offering a glimpse into the movie&apos;s
          action-packed narrative. Dhanush portrays a violent character fiercely

          The nearly 3-minute trailer is filled with gunshots, swordfights,
          explosions and other high-octane sequences, previewing the
          movie&apos;s frenetic action. Dhanush appears to be defending his
          village and its mines against the British troops. Towards the end,
          it&apos;s revealed he was formerly a British soldier himself who held
          the rank of Captain Miller.

          The Central Board of Film Certification in India recently instructed

          Directed by Arun Matheshwaran, the film stars Dhanush along with

          Spears has previously stated that she will no longer be releasing her
          own music. Larry Rudolph, her longtime manager, resigned in July 2021,
          while she was still under the notorious conservatorship that ruled her
          life, finances, and voice for nearly 14 years. Rudolph stated that she
          had no plans to resume her profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that year, shortly after her conservatorship ended, she posted
          on Instagram expressing her fear of the music industry and her belief
          that not releasing her own songs was a sign of disobedience to her
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in 2022, she dropped the single &quot;Hold Me Closer,&quot; a
          joint effort with Elton John, which peaked at No. 6 and remained on
          the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 20 weeks. The single &quot;Mind Your
          Business,&quot; which featured will.i.am, was not included in the Hot
          100 and received negative reviews. 2016&apos;s &quot;Glory&quot; was
          Spears&apos; most recent full-length album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spears said in the Wednesday post that it was &quot;far from the
          truth&quot; that her best-selling memoir from 2023, &quot;The Woman In
          Me,&quot; was published without her consent.

        Barroz, directed by and starring Mohanlal, is made in 3D, and it is the
        next big venture of the Malayalam star after Malaikottai Vaaliban.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal, who has spent decades as a household name in the Malayalam
        film industry, has chosen to take on the role of director for Barraoz,
        which is a movie adaption of Barroz: Guardian of D&apos;Gama&apos;s
        Treasure by Lijo Punnoose. The pandemic delayed the release of the
        movie, which had been first announced in 2019. Following a number of
        adjustments, such as Punnoose&apos;s departure from the project, Barroz
        appears to be nearing completion. Mohanlal has welcomed 2024 with a
        fresh movie poster as reassurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal is shown holding a sword and sitting on a hollow horse in the
        poster. He is as majestic as they come, and the legend of the horse
        piques curiosity and raises questions about the world of Barroz.
        <br />
        <br />
        Barroz&apos;s book is based on a legend regarding Vasco da Gama&apos;s
        treasure, who traveled through Kerala to reach India. Considering that
        the novel was written by Lijo Punnoose, the man behind the first 3D film
        in India, My Dear Kuttichathan (1984), one can anticipate a visually
        stunning and all-around family-friendly film.
        <br />
        <br />
        The film stars Pranav Mohanlal alongside Ignacio Mateos, Ceast Lorente
        Raton, Guru Somasundaram, and Komal Sharma. The film&apos;s soundtrack
        is being composed by South African composer Mark Kilian, while Lydian
        Nadharswaram is in charge of the songs.

        Rinku Dhawan and Neil Bhatt, two competitors, left the Bigg Boss 17
        house last night. Both of them, especially Rinku, who aimed to be
        impartial and least affected on the show, played the game with grace.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even about Munawar Faruqui&apos;s private life being dragged on the
        show, Rinku Dhawan expressed her opinions. &quot;Nobody deserves such a
        public trial, Munawar or anybody else,&quot; she declared. We must
        exercise tact. It&apos;s just wrong to publicly criticize others and
        make disparaging remarks. Munawar&apos;s problem was unnecessary and
        went too far.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku continued, &quot;Yes, Mannara is behind Munawar,&quot; in
        reference to Mannara Chopra and Ayesha Khan. I also informed her during
        the show that our friendship is only genuine until all the requirements
        are met. You have to start doubting that friendship the moment they
        don&apos;t. This implies that it is biased. I am unable to determine
        whether Ayesha has defamed Munawar because she has her own narrative,
        which he is not disputing. However, she could have waited since they
        both acknowledged that they were not committed, so yes, she picked the
        wrong moment and venue to apologize. Munawar could have handled it even
        then; she could have returned with the trophy after the show.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku Dhawan speaks out against the toxic masculinity that exists on the
        show, even though she is certain that Munawar will win the trophy.
        &quot;Abhishek&apos;s outbursts of rage at home are inappropriate. And
        no one speaks out against it. Munawar is harmful to himself and wrong to
        not deal with his circumstances and find closure. Vicky needs to make
        amends for his ability to playfully step on people&apos;s feelings in
        order to get ahead of them all.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku went on to say that there is no chance of reconciliation between
        Abhishek and Isha; in fact, she said of Vicky and Ankita&apos;s ongoing
        arguments, &quot;Vicky and Ankita are both strong personalities, so when
        they come on this big platform, they will clash.&quot;

        Bollywood star John Abraham recently bought an opulent bungalow in
        Mumbai&apos;s sought-after Khar neighborhood. With a price tag of Rs
        70.83 crore, the property is large, measuring 5,416 square feet. The
        actor also purchased the 7,722 square foot plot of land that the
        bungalow is located on.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the help of property registration documents that IndexTap.com was
        able to obtain, the deal was formally registered on December 27, 2023.
        Moneycontrol.com claims that John paid Rs 4.24 crore in stamp duty for
        the property.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abhraham&apos;s new residence is situated in the heart of
        Mumbai&apos;s lively residential area, on the Linking Road in Khar, one
        of the city&apos;s busiest shopping thoroughfares. In addition to its
        commercial significance, the area is well-known for being close to a
        number of educational institutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to space restrictions, Bollywood stars usually prefer to live
        vertically in upscale apartments; however, industry veterans are
        typically the ones who own the horizontal properties. Based on data
        gathered from the website, residential real estate in Khar is priced
        between Rs 40,000 and Rs 90,000 per square foot.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abraham&apos;s action comes in the wake of the recent publicity
        surrounding Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan, who made waves by giving
        his daughter Shweta Bachchan ownership of his Juhu-based bungalow,
        Prateeksha. The ownership transfer, valued at approximately Rs 50.63
        crore, was formalized on November 8 with the filing of two distinct gift
        deeds and the payment of Rs 50.65 lakh in stamp duty.
        <br />
        <br />
        John&apos;s most recent film appearance was in Pathaan, starring Shah
        Rukh Khan. In the movie, he portrayed an antagonist. John is working on
        several projects at the moment, such as Vedaa, Tariq, Tehran, and The
        Diplomat.

        Numerous sightings of Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan together have
        sparked rumors that they have been dating since 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        The actors Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan have long been the focus of
        dating rumors. This rumor started because of the photos where Ibrahim
        was spotted at Palak&apos;s house. The young actors haven&apos;t
        revealed their relationship to the public despite being frequently
        spotted together. But when they were spotted together last night on New
        Year&apos;s Eve, dating rumors were sparked. The focus of the video was
        Ibrahim&apos;s choice to keep his face hidden from the paparazzi.
        <br />
        <br />
        Palak Tiwari, the Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan actor, was spotted in a car
        with Ibrahim Ali Khan and another friend. However, when they saw the
        photographers, Sara Ali Khan&apos;s brother and Saif Ali Khan&apos;s son
        had an unexpected reaction. In the video, Ibrahim can be seen covering
        his face with his jacket. Rumors of a romantic relationship between
        Palak and Ibrahim date back to 2022. In fact, Shweta Tiwari&apos;s
        daughter Palak clarified in one of her interviews that Ibrahim is just a
        &quot;nice friend.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of her career, Palak is preparing to play herself in the film
        The Virgin Tree, which also features Mouni Roy and Sanjay Dutt. But
        Ibrahim will make his Bollywood debut in Sarzameen, which is also
        starring Kajol and is directed by Kayoze, Boman Irani&apos;s son.

        Now that 2024 has arrived, Malayalam megastar Mammootty is set to rule
        the scene for an additional year, having captivated audiences in 2023
        with his compelling film selections and potent performances.

        The excitement for Mammootty&apos;s upcoming film Bramayugam has
        increased as he has unveiled a new poster that features him in an avatar
        that has never been seen before, kicking off the year on a high note.
        The most recent poster, which was unveiled a few months ago, is similar
        to the first look poster in that it features a monochromatic theme but
        presents the actor&apos;s character from a different angle.

        The new poster features Mammootty&apos;s character wearing a crown that
        looks like it was worn by those who practiced the ancient folk ritual
        art form of Theyyam. It also has makeup that suggests Mammootty is not
        your typical human, and it has attached horns. Bramayugam, directed by
        Rahul Sadasivan, who rose to fame with his first feature Bhoothakaalam,
        is a full-fledged horror movie with a strong historical setting in
        Kerala&apos;s dark ages. The movie&apos;s chilling premise is further
        highlighted by its tagline, &quot;the age of madness.&quot;

        With the release of the most recent poster, Mammootty wished all of his
        fans a happy New Year. Bramayugam, which was co-produced by Night Shift
        Studios and YNot Studios, also stars Shehnad Jalal as director of
        photography, Shafique Mohammed Ali as editor, and Christo Xavier as
        music composer. Notable roles are played by Arjun Ashokan, Sidharth
        Bharathan, and Amalda Liz.

        &quot;I am thrilled to be living the dream of directing the iconic
        Mammookka,&quot; Rahul declared at the beginning of the movie&apos;s
        production, which wrapped up in October. Bramayugam is a deeply felt
        tale that takes place in Kerala&apos;s dark ages, and I&apos;m happy
        that the producers are pushing the envelope to create an immersive
        cinematic experience. I hope fans of the genre everywhere as well as
        those of Mammookka will find it delightful.

        The precise release date of the movie is still unknown, despite
        unsubstantiated rumors that it will premiere in February. The film will
        be released in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi in addition to its
        original Malayalam version.
