          Deepika Padukone has been noticeably absent from promotions for her
          upcoming film Fighter, including skipping the trailer launch event
          earlier this month. In a recent interview with Bollywood Hungama,
          director Siddharth Anand addressed the speculation around
          Deepika&apos;s lack of visibility and explained it is part of their
          promotional strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about Deepika&apos;s absence and the chatter about it on
          social media, Siddharth said people often make conjectures but this
          was a deliberate decision. He revealed Deepika was meant to attend the
          trailer launch but fell ill, and would now be &quot;everywhere&quot;
          in promotions from Tuesday onwards.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Siddharth emphasized that doing promotions for Fighter without Deepika
          made no sense. He said, &quot;Obviously we can&apos;t do without
          Deepika...Deepika and Hrithik&apos;s pair is one of the major
          highlights. As a filmmaker, seeing them together is hugely exciting so
          I can only imagine the audience is also waiting for it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the director, holding back on showing too much of Deepika
          and Hrithik before release was intentional. He wanted audiences to
          enjoy their chemistry and magic unfold on the big screen without
          reaching a saturation point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, some reports had claimed Deepika unfollowed Siddharth on
          Instagram, hinting at possible tensions. But the director clarified it
          was always the plan to have Deepika join promotions close to release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fighter stars Hrithik Roshan as Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania,
          Deepika Padukone as Squadron Leader Minal Rathore and Anil Kapoor as
          Group Captain Rakesh Jai Singh. It revolves around the elite Air
          Dragons unit and their internal and external battles.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-octane action film marks Deepika and Hrithik&apos;s first
          on-screen collaboration. It is also Deepika&apos;s third project with
          director Siddharth Anand after Bachna Ae Haseeno and Pathaan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          With two of Bollywood&apos;s biggest stars paired up for the first
          time, anticipation for Fighter is sky-high. Siddharth&apos;s comments
          indicate they plan to capitalize on that buzz with Deepika front and
          center of promotions in the final run-up to release. Her millions of
          fans will undoubtedly be glad to finally see their favorite star
          highlighting the film they&apos;ve eagerly awaited.

          Veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan shared photos on his blog from his
          visit to the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya for the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of
          Ram Lalla. He attended the special event on Monday before returning to
          Mumbai late at night.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The megastar posted pictures of the Ram Lalla deity inside the new
          temple, as well as exterior shots of the magnificent structure. He
          included a photo of himself with folded hands, seeking blessings on
          the spiritually significant occasion. Amitabh opted for traditional
          attire and a shawl for the ceremony.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Describing it as a day filled with divine relevance, he wrote “Back
          from the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at Ayodhya.” Amitabh was accompanied
          to Ayodhya by his son and fellow actor Abhishek Bachchan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          After the ceremony, Amitabh and Abhishek also met with Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Photos
          show Amitabh greeting CM Adityanath with folded hands and conversing,
          before Abhishek joined them. PM Modi also welcomed Amitabh with folded
          hands, which the screen icon returned respectfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Amitabh recently purchased a 10,000 square foot plot of
          land in Ayodhya, further showing his deep connection to the holy city.
          The registrar confirmed the ₹9 crore transaction for the property was
          completed, with Amitabh&apos;s lawyer executing the agreement on his
          behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the Bachchans, many other Bollywood celebrities like
          Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Anupam Kher, Kangana Ranaut, and Sonu Nigam
          attended the momentous Ram Mandir ceremony. With approximately 8,000
          invitees including 1,500 VIP guests, the event featured stunning
          visuals of army helicopters showering flowers on the new temple.

          Deepika Padukone and Hrithik Roshan is generating immense buzz ahead
          of its release on January 25th. The film about Indian Air Force pilots
          has already recorded massive advance bookings of 86,516 tickets worth
          ₹2.84 crores for day one, as per industry tracker Sacnilk.{" "}

          from Delhi (₹67.39 lakhs), Maharashtra (₹75.02 lakhs), Telangana
          (₹40.73 lakhs) and Karnataka (₹43.54 lakhs).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Fighter&apos; is said to be inspired by the 2019 Pulwama attack
          and India&apos;s response. The 2 hour 46 minute film has received a
          U/A certificate from CBFC.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the synopsis, it revolves around an elite IAF unit called
          Air Dragons created to tackle militancy in Srinagar. Comprising the
          best combat aviators, they are the first responders against hostile
          activity. The story shows their struggles in balancing duty and
          personal lives while serving the nation.{" "}

          Directed by Siddharth Anand, &apos;Fighter&apos; stars Hrithik Roshan,
          Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor in lead roles, supported by Karan
          Singh Grover, Akshay Oberoi and Talat Aziz. Centered on the lives of
          IAF officers, the film releases on January 25th.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The incredible advance booking numbers testify to the star power of
          Hrithik-Deepika and the hype around their first film together. Their
          sizzling on-screen chemistry has fans thrilled.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the patriotic and action-packed storyline has struck a chord
          after the success of &apos;Uri: The Surgical Strike&apos; recently.
          &apos;Fighter&apos; seems poised to provide a realistic glimpse into
          the exploits of our brave air force pilots.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          With zero competition at the box office currently, the film is
          expected to take off to a flying start. The Republic Day weekend will
          give it an extended opening of almost 5 days. If the content lives up
          to expectations, &apos;Fighter&apos; could be the first blockbuster of
          2023.

          rituals. The temple complex spans 70 acres.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The temple trust has invited over 7,000 people including politicians,
          celebrities, cricketers, industrialists and more. Rajinikanth,

          The grand temple is seen as a testament to their unwavering faith and

          cannot be denied.{" "}

          The presence of top movie stars also underlines how deeply Lord Ram

          The Sankranti 2023 box office results have surprised the Telugu film
          industry. The festival period usually sees a clash between big star
          releases vying for audience attention. This year, all eyes were on
          Mahesh Babu&apos;s &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, his collaboration with
          hitmaker Trivikram Srinivas after &apos;Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo&apos;.
          But a relatively smaller film, &apos;HanuMan&apos; starring Teja
          Sajja, has emerged as the unlikely winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos; saw an upswing over the weekend but
          continued lagging behind &apos;HanuMan&apos;. On Day 9, it collected
          ₹3.25 crores domestically. Despite a jump in footfalls on Day 10, the
          film could only manage ₹3.50 crores. Its total now stands at ₹118
          crores. In contrast, &apos;HanuMan&apos; earned ₹14.6 crores on Day 9
          and a huge ₹16.50 crores on Day 10. Its domestic total has crossed
          ₹130 crores, far ahead of Mahesh Babu&apos;s film.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The other Sankranti releases - Nagarjuna&apos;s &apos;Naa Saami
          Ranga&apos; and Venkatesh&apos;s &apos;Sanidhav&apos; - have collected
          ₹26 crores and ₹14 crores respectively. Clearly, the underdog
          &apos;HanuMan&apos; has won over the audience.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This outcome has surprised many since Mahesh Babu typically has a huge
          fan following. The producer of &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, Naga Vamsi,
          acknowledged issues with the film&apos;s promotion. He said late night
          1am shows sent the wrong signal for a family entertainer unlike an
          action film. Release strategies need to suit the genre, he admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics have pointed to the film&apos;s predictable storyline and lack
          of freshness as reasons for the lukewarm response.
          &apos;HanuMan&apos;, in contrast, garnered praise for its novel
          superhero premise and CGI effects. Word-of-mouth has been a key factor
          in its rise.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sankranti battle shows the power of content over star power. For
          veteran stars like Mahesh Babu, their brand value can drive openings
          but the film needs to offer more. Underdog films can triumph with
          unique and compelling stories. Perhaps Telugu cinema is maturing
          towards scripts mattering as much as scales and stars.

          and an estimated Rs 2.40 crore on Sunday. This takes its total

          of Indian Express gave it 2 stars. She praised Tripathi as &quot;born
          to play this part&quot; with his command over Hindi and speech rhythms
          being &quot;so hypnotic.&quot;{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she felt even an actor of Tripathi&apos;s caliber could not
          do much with such a reductive script. She remarked that instead of a
          rounded portrait, what we get is a narrative of Vajpayee as a budding
          politician who shaped the Jan Sangh, Janata Party and the current BJP.
        </p>
        <p>
          More positive reviews highlighted Tripathi&apos;s brilliant mimicry
          and how he compellingly captured Vajpayee&apos;s mannerisms. But many
          agreed the script tended to hero-worship Vajpayee rather than
          critically analyze his lengthy political journey.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The mixed response indicates that while Indian audiences are eager for
          more political biopics, there is also greater demand now for nuanced
          storytelling rather than hagiographies. For &apos;Main Atal Hoon&apos;
          to pick up pace at the box office, it may need strong word of mouth
          based on Tripathi&apos;s performance.

          Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has recently disclosed how a stunt accident on
          the sets of his 2013 Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chennai Express brought
          back traumatic memories of a fatal mishap under his late father MB
          Shetty&apos;s supervision in the 1980 film Bombay 405 Miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Bombay 405 Miles, featuring Shatrughan Sinha, MB Shetty was the
          action director. Sinha&apos;s body double Mansoor had to jump from a
          warehouse as part of a stunt sequence involving a huge blast.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview, Rohit Shetty recounted how during the shoot, due to
          chaos and confusion, the blast operator and camera operator had
          inadvertently switched positions unbeknownst to Shetty. So when
          Mansoor jumped, Shetty signaled the blast technician assuming he was
          the cameraman. The warehouse exploded with Mansoor inside, leading to
          his demise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty was a child then and only heard about the horrific accident in
          the evening. A year later, his father passed away as well, overcome by
          guilt over the incident. Though MB Shetty had a strong reputation
          among industry folks, this tragedy weighed heavily on him. He turned
          to alcoholism, withdrew from work and remained homebound before his
          death. The family understood his suffering led to his premature demise
          – destiny&apos;s cruelty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty then described a controlled car blast scene in Chennai Express.
          Though his team removes fuel tanks for such stunts, some petrol had
          spilled on the chassis while prepping. Unbeknownst to them, the
          imported car had a reserve tank. After filming the scene, a spark
          reignited the splattered petrol, engulfing the car in flames with
          veteran stuntman Shankar Anna inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          They panicked as the flaming, overturned car trapped Shankar inside.
          Fortunately fire brigades on standby doused the flames, broke the
          glass and rescued him with minor burns. The chilling parallel to his
          father&apos;s long-ago accident shook Shetty deeply before he gathered
          himself and rushed Shankar to the hospital. He has fully recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interview, Shetty called his mother Ratna a &quot;fighter&quot;
          who raised him and his sister through immense hardship after his
          father&apos;s death. Despite struggles and poverty, she shielded them
          from sadness and nurtured a stoic work ethic. To support the family,
          she resumed stunt doubling for stars, having met MB Shetty through
          this work. If you notice the top-angle shots in Andaaz song Zindagi Ek
          Safar, Ratna is the one sitting there!
        </p>
        <p>
          After Shetty started working, Ratna stopped and their fortunes
          changed. But he inherited her grit to face challenges head-on. Shetty
          feels that as long as there is work, there is hope. He remains
          eternally grateful to his mother for shielding him throughout the
          decade-long adversity after his father&apos;s passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The director has now made his streaming debut with the Prime Video
          series Indian Police Force starring Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi
          and Shilpa Shetty.

          With his first foray into the OTT space, filmmaker Rohit Shetty brings
          his signature crash-bang formulaic cop drama to the streaming universe
          with &apos;Indian Police Force&apos;. Teaming up with co-director
          Sushwanth Prakash, Shetty packs the 7-episode show with the
          over-the-top tropes and tactics seen in his box office hit franchises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans of the director&apos;s &apos;Singham&apos; and &apos;Simmba&apos;
          films won&apos;t find surprises here. The series stays squarely in
          Shetty&apos;s wheelhouse, cramming in evil Muslim terrorists countered
          by valiant Muslim officers, contrived plots threatening innocents, and
          vehicles spinning wildly through the air. Romantic song interludes
          between the lead pair stretch the runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          References to his previous cop heroes Singham and Simmba reinforce
          we&apos;re in familiar territory, transplanted to Delhi though largely
          realized through obvious CGI landmarks. It&apos;s a greatest hits of
          elements from Shetty&apos;s cinematic cop sagas, now extended into an
          episodic streaming iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his heavy-hitter lead stars Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn and Ranveer
          Singh unavailable, Shetty casts Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi and
          Shilpa Shetty as the khaki-clad officers. They sport the mandatory
          sculpted midriffs and tough guy Ray-Ban glares synonymous with the
          director&apos;s testosterone-fueled style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vivek Oberoi is compelling but underutilized as the washed-up
          inspector reinstated for one last case. Sidharth Malhotra&apos;s
          wide-eyed sincerity sits oddly with the brute force his character
          employs. But Shilpa Shetty seems to relish playing the badass officer
          known simply by her surname, getting in on the kicking and punching
          action. Here&apos;s hoping she sees more of that in a likely second
          season.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the freedom of streaming, Shetty delivers his signature bells and
          whistles without the price of a theater ticket. Logic, nuance and
          detail are beside the point in this turbo-charged spectacle. The
          director&apos;s steadfast formula marches on, now reaching fans&apos;
          screens at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; relies on familiar devices like
          misdirection and sleight of hand rather than air-tight plotting to
          propel its thin story. The cast is decorative, tasked with modeling
          police apparel and dodging explosions rather than embodying
          characters. Fans seeking high-octane stunts and mindless entertainment
          will get their fill.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those expecting evolution or innovation in Shetty&apos;s
          storytelling may be disappointed. The show brings his high-decibel cop
          anthems to OTT largely unchanged. For devotees of the director&apos;s
          campy maximalism, it&apos;s a familiar fast food fix now delivered via
          streaming. With a captive audience at home, seasoning is optional when
          serving more of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The debut season amounts to an all-you-can-eat Rohit Shetty cop drama
          buffet. Logical restraint and nuance won&apos;t be on the menu. But
          stunts will be super-sized along with the pyrotechnics. So viewers
          craving adventures in Shetty&apos;s OTT universe can have their
          expectations met by this platter of the director&apos;s greatest hits.
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; offers a tried and tested sensory
          overload feast for fans seeking familiar flavor.

          Rumors of an engagement between Telugu film stars Vijay Deverakonda
          and Rashmika Mandanna have resurfaced, with some reports even
          speculating a February wedding. However, Vijay has categorically
          denied these latest rumors in a recent interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing the claims, Vijay remarked, &quot;I&apos;m not getting
          engaged or married in February.&quot; He added, seemingly weary of the
          recurring speculation, &quot;It feels like the press just wants to get
          me married every two years. I hear this rumor every year.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vijay and Rashmika first sparked relationship speculation after
          starring together in the 2018 Telugu hit Geetha Govindam, later
          reteaming for the 2019 film Dear Comrade. While not publicly
          confirming their status, the two have been spotted together on
          multiple occasions over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, they were seen vacationing at a beach resort in the
          Maldives. More recently, the supposed couple was photographed
          holidaying in Vietnam, fueling rumors they are now living together and
          may formalize their relationship soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professionally, both actors have been riding high. Rashmika is basking
          in the success of Animal with Ranbir Kapoor, and will next be seen in
          the eagerly awaited sequel Pushpa 2: The Rule alongside Allu Arjun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Vijay starred opposite Samantha Ruth Prabhu in this
          year&apos;s Tamil rom-com Khushi. He has the upcoming Telugu films
          Family Star and VD12 with director Gowtam Tinnanuri in the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while their admirers may be willing it, Vijay has quashed the
          latest gossip about an engagement or wedding with Rashmika. However,
          the tight-lipped co-stars continue to remain coy about the true nature
          of their bond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time will tell whether the patterns of the past repeat, with more
          joint vacations and sightings further fueling rumors of romance. For
          now though, Vijay asserts the February wedding chatter holds no water.

          Like Wilde, Orry represents a bold rejection of convention and an
          unapologetic commitment to self-expression. Where Wilde faced
          hostility for his sexuality and bohemian lifestyle in Victorian
          England, Orry draws ire today for shunning expectations of how
          celebrities should behave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both serve as a mirror that reflects the discomfiting truths about
          societal prejudice. Their disregard for norms enrages the
          &apos;incalculably stupid brutes and illiterates&apos; unable to
          appreciate their artistry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wilde was prosecuted by the Marquess of Queensberry, who abhorred the
          playwright&apos;s affairs with his son. Despite friends counseling
          prudence, an indignant Wilde sued the Marquess for libel over a note
          calling him a &quot;posing sodomite.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What followed was a ruthless trial by media aiming to prove
          Wilde&apos;s homosexuality. His Dublin acquaintance Edward Carson
          ruthlessly cross-examined him, despising Wilde for consorting with
          lower classes. When asked about the morality of art, Wilde famously
          replied works of art are simply good or bad, not moral or immoral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, those mocking Orry fail to recognize art and thought when
          confronted by it. Like Wilde, Orry lives in &apos;incalculably stupid
          times&apos; too blinkered to appreciate true originality.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Bertrand Russell noted, conventional minds rage at nonconformity
          because they see it as criticism of themselves. Orry draws ire for not
          obeying the usual star rules. Unlike nepotistic actors ruining
          classics, he embraces life as his own film, liberated from PR diktats.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spurns industry rituals and misogynistic tropes masquerading as
          cinema. Unlike reclusive creators like Harper Lee, Orry actively
          engages the world on his own terms. His autonomy threatens
          establishments invested in compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The philosopher Ramadhir Singh observed people inhabit personal dream
          worlds. Orry has transcended this limitation to seamlessly merge his
          inner life and outward persona. His self-actualization elicits anger
          from those unable to achieve this liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Wilde, Orry represents the timeless struggle between convention
          and creativity, tradition and novelty, repression and rebellion. Both
          expose society&apos;s tendency to vilify nonconformists exposing
          suppressed truths. They pay a price for providing that mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          But visionaries who reject the familiar for fresh horizons often must
          withstand hostility from blinkered minds. Art that challenges
          orthodoxies inevitably provokes backlash. However, daring spirits like
          Orry and Wilde also open the door to progress and new possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though differing in context, Orry and Wilde&apos;s journeys highlight
          the burdens born by those rejecting the beaten path. Convention exerts
          a powerful pull that visionaries must overcome. Both inspire kindred
          spirits to live courageously, even if it draws ridicule from the
          &apos;incalculably stupid&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          By boldly pursuing self-expression over conformity, they light the way
          for future generations to actualize their inner cinema, unencumbered
          by others’ limited perceptions. Orry, like Wilde, represents the
          eternally alluring promise of fearlessly being oneself.

          The new Netflix true crime documentary American Nightmare transcends
          the usual reductive tropes of the genre to deliver a piercing critique
          of flawed policing, everyday sexism, and ultimately, a moving love
          story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Created by the talented team behind The Tinder Swindler, American
          Nightmare revisits a brief media frenzy from 2015 that drew
          comparisons to Gone Girl. Young blonde woman Denise Huskins was
          reported missing by her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, who claimed they were
          attacked by masked intruders who kidnapped Denise after binding and
          sedating him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cops immediately suspected Aaron was lying. Why would anyone
          kidnap Denise? Why demand a measly $15,000 ransom? And didn&apos;t
          Aaron confess to emotionally cheating on Denise because he wanted his
          ex back? Sensing Gone Girl vibes, the police zeroed in on Aaron as the
          prime suspect, threatening to label him a &quot;monster.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The case exploded when Denise suddenly reappeared at her family home
          48 hours after vanishing, traumatized and needing time to process her
          ordeal before talking to police. But the cops refused, convinced this
          was an elaborate hoax. Mere hours after Denise&apos;s return, they
          held a press conference accusing her of wasting resources on a wild
          goose chase.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare intricately recounts events through extensive
          interviews with Aaron and Denise, interrogation footage, lawyer
          inputs, and a journalist who covered the saga. The filmmakers
          skillfully cherry pick key moments to spin an engaging story while
          assuming viewer unfamiliarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the most impressive aspect is the even-handed tone taken on this
          complex case. The procedural route or salacious angle were obvious
          options passed over. Instead, American Nightmare is a remarkably
          level-headed exploration of a real-life tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s astonishing how gracefully Denise and Aaron handled the
          media maelstrom. The show calls out prejudiced press coverage and a
          gullible public ever-eager to anoint new villains just to feel morally
          superior. Even Gone Girl&apos;s Amazing Amy didn&apos;t suffer this
          degree of indignity, and she was an actual criminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the investigation proceeds, the couple&apos;s version of events
          checks out. The meticulous methodology and odd ransom demand point to
          a sophisticated extortion ring later uncovered. But the damage was
          done. Aaron&apos;s reputation and career were left in tatters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through extensive interviews, Denise and Aaron&apos;s incredible bond
          emerges, stronger than ever. We learn of Aaron&apos;s protective
          nature, traced back to his firefighter father&apos;s emphasis on
          serving others. Despite law enforcement&apos;s betrayal, the couple
          displays uncommon grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviews with willful investigators unwilling to admit mistakes
          reveal deep systemic flaws in policing - confirmation bias, sloppy
          detection, and macho posturing supersede the truth. The press comes
          off even worse, salivating for a juicy &apos;he did it&apos; plot
          instead of waiting for facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare ultimately transcends genre by training its focus
          on flawed institutions and everyday misogyny rather than
          sensationalism. An impeccably crafted, morally grounded piece, it
          serves as an inspiring example of two ordinary people displayed
          uncommon courage under fire.

          Talented actor Bhumi Pednekar is set to deliver another powerful
          performance in the upcoming Netflix investigative drama Bhakshak.
          Produced by Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan&apos;s renowned production
          house Red Chillies Entertainment, the highly anticipated film is
          slated for release on Netflix on February 9th.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhumi unveiled the intense teaser on social media, describing it as
          the story of a committed journalist who perseveres to uncover the
          truth no matter what. Bhakshak is inspired by real life events that
          took place in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teaser provides a glimpse of Bhumi portraying the role of Vaishali
          Singh, a determined investigative journalist seeking to expose a
          horrific crime and shed light on the dismal reality of violence
          against women in society. Commenting on the film&apos;s hard-hitting
          theme, the director expressed that the aim is to highlight difficult
          realities and generate meaningful conversations that can lead to
          positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaurav Verma, producer at Red Chillies Entertainment, conveyed that
          they believe in storytelling that not only engages audiences but also
          enlightens them. He described Bhakshak as a testimony to their
          commitment to thought-provoking narratives that encourage social
          reflections. They are excited to partner with Netflix to share this
          impactful story with global audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruchikaa Kapoor Sheikh from Netflix India added that Bhakshak is an
          intense story following a resolute journalist&apos;s unfaltering
          pursuit of justice against all obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helmed by director Pulkit, Bhakshak also features impressive
          performances by Sanjay Mishra, Aditya Srivastava and Sai Tamhankar
          essaying pivotal roles. But Bhumi takes centerstage in her portrayal
          of the fierce journalist at the heart of this hard-hitting story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set to premiere exclusively on Netflix on February 9th, the promising
          investigative drama marks another career defining performance by Bhumi
          Pednekar in the central role.

          revealed the plot line.

        <p>
          According to the IMDb synopsis, the film revolves around a couple in
          love who must alter their destiny due to negative energy. This
          description sparked speculation among fans about the storyline.
          However, the director, Maruthi, clarified the situation with a playful
          comment on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a platform called X, Maruthi expressed, &quot;Ararare, I don’t know

          This statement makes it clear that the plot mentioned on IMDb is not
          the current focus of Prabhas and Maruthi&apos;s collaboration. Similar
          to many high-budget projects, the details of the film&apos;s storyline
          are likely to remain under wraps until the trailer is released, which
          might take some time.

        <p>
          In the meantime, Prabhas is gearing up for his next major project,
          &quot;Kalki 2898 AD,&quot; directed by Nag Ashwin. This dystopian
          sci-fi thriller, featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, and Deepika

          Veteran actor Shakti Kapoor, known for his iconic villainous and

          incident from the shooting of the 1982 movie Satte Pe Satta. In an

          peak in Bollywood, he was quite possessive and particular about his
          scenes and dialogues. However, this behavior made him the target of a
          prank engineered by Amitabh Bachchan and other actors on the Satte Pe
          Satta set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling somewhat insecure being one of seven actors in the film,
          Shakti Kapoor sought reassurance from director Raj N Sippy, who
          vouched he was ‘as good as Amitabh Bachchan.’ Shakti had also
          innovatively incorporated a stammer into his character&apos;s dialogue
          delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Narrating the prank played on him by Big B and co-stars, Shakti said,
          “We were shooting for the song ‘Dukki Pe Dukki Ho.’ My second dialogue
          was in the song. I was waiting for the shot when I saw Amitabh
          Bachchan saying my dialogue instead. I thought, ‘Amitabh is saying my
          dialogue. My career is over.’ I assumed as a star he could do
          anything. He took my dialogue. I went to the director and complained
          ‘this is not fair.’ All six actors were sitting behind a bush watching
          me cry and started clapping saying, ‘We’re joking with you.’ The
          camera wasn’t rolling. They thought Shakti Kapoor is so serious about
          his scenes and dialogues, let’s prank him. Amitabh then told the
          director to give me 3-4 more shots saying ‘He will die otherwise.’”
        </p>
        <p>
          Satte Pe Satta, released in 1982, is a Hindi action comedy film
          directed by Raj N Sippy and produced by Romu N Sippy. Starring Amitabh
          Bachchan, Hema Malini, Amjad Khan and others, it revolves around seven
          unsophisticated brothers who are civilized by Indu (Malini), wife of
          the eldest Ravi Anand (Bachchan). The plot takes a twist when Ravi’s
          lookalike Babu is ordered by cunning uncle Ranjit Singh (Khan) to
          murder disabled heiress Seema Singh (Ranjeeta Kaur). Adapted from
          Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), it is regarded as a Bollywood
          classic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behind-the-scenes anecdote provides insight into Shakti
          Kapoor&apos;s dedication and insecurity as a character actor sharing
          screen space with superstar Amitabh Bachchan. It also showcases the
          playful camaraderie between co-stars on set. The prank indicates that
          Shakti was initially perceived as an overly earnest performer by his
          co-stars, who decided to pull his leg.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Amitabh ensuring additional shots for Shakti afterwards
          demonstrates his graciousness and professional courtesy towards a
          co-actor. Overall, the incident provides a humorous glimpse into the
          personalities and equations between some of Bollywood&apos;s biggest
          stars in their prime decades ago, especially the towering impact of an
          icon like Bachchan. It adds another memorable moment to the rich
          nostalgia surrounding an all-time classic like Satte Pe Satta nearly
          four decades later.

          and black sequin saree on Instagram. &quot;Gold & Glitter,&quot; she
          aptly captioned the post, earning praise from fans calling her a
          &quot;Golden Diva&quot; and &quot;Golden Girl of India.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The pre-draped saree featured dazzling gold diamantes embellishing the
          entire front, a ruffled pallu split into three floor-sweeping trains,
          ruffled pleats, ankle-grazing hem, and a figure-hugging cinched
          silhouette. She paired it with a gold bustier blouse having broad
          straps, shimmery beaded work, fitted bodice, plunging sweetheart
          neckline with front slit, and a curved super-cropped hem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping accessories minimal, Shehnaaz wore just a dainty gold bracelet
          and heels. Her glam picks included winged black eyeliner, golden eye
          shadow, feathered brows, glossy caramel lips, blushed cheeks, and
          highlighted contours. Flowing center-parted locks styled in
          well-defined curls completed her party-perfect look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz was last seen in the 2022 film Thank You For Coming, starring
          alongside Bhumi Pednekar, Dolly Singh, Kusha Kapila and Shibani Bedi.
          The movie also premiered at the 46th Toronto International Film
          Festival (TIFF) in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor frequently makes best-dressed lists for her experimental
          fashion choices spanning ethnic, fusion, casual and glamorous looks.
          Be it sarees, lehengas, gowns or corset designs, Shehnaaz carries both
          Indian and Western ensembles with flair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gold and black sequin Gaurav Gupta number gave a glitzy upgrade to
          the traditional saree. The sensual bustier styling with a saree draped
          around the waist created an alluring Indo-Western vibe. The
          embellished fabric, sultry palette and figure-hugging silhouette made
          it perfect for cocktail nights or receptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz proved sequins can work beautifully for evening ethnic wear,
          beyond just plain silks or chiffons. Her outfit gave inspiration for
          modern Indian women who want to give the saree a sexy twist. The
          plunging neckline, strappy sleeves, sequin work and cropped pallu gave
          traditional drapes a contemporary makeover.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor showed how fusion pairings like the bustier-saree can add
          drama and oomph for wedding functions and parties. While the black and
          gold color scheme lent a classical elegance, the shimmery
          embellishments and sensual styling gave it a glamorous edge.
          Shehnaaz&apos;s red carpet-worthy ensemble exemplified her
          experimental and confident sense of style.

              conflicts kept them apart. Eagle-eyed fans noticed Swift
              strategically placing her hand near her mouth, likely avoiding a
              viral moment à la Selena Gomez at the Globes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earlier, Donna had said she would be in the heated skybox despite
              below-freezing winds and temperatures plunging to -27°C. &quot;I
              have to have a blanket and I’ll have my winter coat on,&quot; she
              stated. This was Swift&apos;s 5th Chiefs game out of 6 at
              Arrowhead Stadium. She told Time Magazine, &quot;By the time I
              went to that first game, we were a couple.&quot; Swift added they
              would never “hard launch a first date” at a game.

        <p>
          Sharad Kelkar, one of the most recognizable voices in Bollywood,
          recently discussed his experiences dubbing for South Indian films. He
          is known for voicing Prabhas&apos; characters in the Hindi dubbed
          versions of films like Baahubali and Salaar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar shared that he used to stammer as a child and never imagined he
          would become an actor or voice actor. On dubbing for South films, he
          said the recognition he got for voicing Prabhas was immense, unlike
          anything seen before in the voicing industry. He noted how audiences
          now notice the voice artists, like Shreyas Talpade in Pushpa and
          Sachin Gole for Yash in KGF.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Kelkar, Baahubali brought about this change and made
          people recognize and respect voice actors. He wants filmmakers to
          start crediting voice actors in movie posters and end credits, like
          it&apos;s done in Hollywood animated films. He feels voice actors in
          India don&apos;t get their due.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussing overcoming his stammering, Kelkar shared that correcting
          his breathing pattern helped stop his stammering. People started
          noticing his voice after that. To improve his voice modulation, he
          observed other actors&apos; dialogue delivery. Once the stammering
          reduced, he learned the craft of dubbing from coach Mona Shetty.
          Starting with small projects, his big break was Baahubali.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar&apos;s next voice acting project is Hotstar&apos;s animated
          series The Legend of Hanuman, where he has voiced Ravana. He chooses
          projects based on the writing. He wanted to break the cliche and
          present a new perspective on Ravana. As an actor, voicing mythological
          characters allows exploring them in new ways. Overall, Kelkar wants
          writers to get more recognition in India for their critical
          contribution.

          Mahesh Babu’s highly anticipated return to screens after two years in
          the Trivikram Srinivas-directorial ‘SSMB28’, titled ‘Guntur Kaaram’,
          has received a roaring response on its opening day. According to early
          estimates by trade website Sacnilk, the film has collected a gross of
          Rs 50 crore on day one, reflecting Mahesh Babu’s star power.
        </p>
        <p>
          As expected, the lion’s share of the collection for ‘Guntur Kaaram’
          came from the Telugu superstar’s stronghold of Andhra Pradesh and
          Telangana. The estimated gross from the Telugu territories was
          approximately Rs 44.5 crore. This was followed by Karnataka with Rs
          4.5 crore gross, Tamil Nadu with Rs 0.5 crore and Rs 0.5 crore from
          other parts of India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other major release this Friday was Teja Sajja and director
          Prasanth Varma’s pan-India sci-fi fantasy ‘HanuMan’. Despite positive
          reviews, the film had a more subdued opening day compared to ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’. The total day one net collection for ‘HanuMan’ across all
          languages was Rs 7.56 crore as per estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this, the majority Rs 5.5 crore net came from the Telugu version.
          The Hindi dubbed version contributed Rs 2 crore, while other languages
          chipped in with Rs 0.06 crore. However, the unique genre and
          word-of-mouth are expected to attract the family audience, especially
          in the Hindi belt where there is a dearth of major releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first weekend remains crucial for both ‘Guntur Kaaram’ and
          ‘HanuMan’ as the Sankranti weekend will see other big Telugu releases
          like Venkatesh’s ‘Saindhav’ and Nagarjuna’s ‘NaanSamruddha’ competing
          for screens and audiences. Trade pundits had predicted Mahesh Babu’s
          film will dominate over the Sankranti releases due to his stardom. It
          remains to be seen if the box office dynamics change as more films
          open.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Trivikram Srinivas, known for several blockbusters, ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’ marks an attempt to deliver a hit after his previous film ‘Ala
          Vaikunthapurramuloo’. Mahesh Babu was last seen in the 2020
          blockbuster ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’. Hence, the combination of the star
          actor and popular director has generated immense buzz among fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Guntur Kaaram’ features Mahesh Babu in the role of an archaeologist
          on a treasure hunt. Pooja Hegde stars as the female lead, while the
          cast includes Jayaram, Sachin Khedekar, and others. The story blends
          comedy, adventure, and supernatural elements against the backdrop of
          Guntur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film’s release in theaters coinciding with the Sankranti festival
          weekend gives it the advantage of attracting big crowds. Moreover,
          Mahesh Babu has a huge fan following across the Telugu states who
          eagerly await his films on the big screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Covid pandemic impacting the entertainment industry over the
          past two years, the response to ‘Guntur Kaaram’ indicates that
          audiences are flocking back to theaters when major stars like Mahesh
          Babu deliver a promising film.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the film sustains its collections over the extended opening week
          and positive word-of-mouth, it is headed towards becoming a huge hit.
          Not just in the Telugu belt, but even markets like Karnataka, Tamil
          Nadu, and Hindi circuits hold potential if content clicks with a wide
          appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Telugu film industry, the success of ‘Guntur Kaaram’ will
          provide a major boost after a difficult pandemic period. And for
          Mahesh Babu, it will cement his standing as one of Tollywood’s most
          bankable superstars with an enviable box office track record.

          In the latest eviction twist, contestant Samarth Jurel has reportedly
          been eliminated from the popular reality show Bigg Boss 17 just ahead
          of the grand finale this month.
        </p>

          As Bigg Boss 17 approaches its finale episode, the show is currently
          in the Family Week phase with visits from contestants&apos; loved
          ones. However, an exciting update has now emerged regarding the
          weekend eviction that has brought immense joy to many fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          There has been growing anticipation and calls from viewers in recent

          With one of the perceived villains now out of the show, the dynamics
          between the remaining Bigg Boss 17 contestants may shift dramatically
          in the final few crucial weeks. Fans are eager to see how the other
          housemates respond to Samarth&apos;s eviction and who rises to
          prominence leading up to the grand finale.

          A memorable story combined with the directing skills of Shiboprosad

          will never be forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only has the movie persevered through the ten new Netflix releases
          in the last fifteen days, but it has done so with steadfast charm and
          resiliency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reunited in the Bengali film industry, Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad
          Mukherjee have begun filming &apos;Aamar Boss,&apos; starring the
          legendary Rakhee Gulzar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee expressed their thoughts on the
          film&apos;s ongoing success in a joint statement, saying, &quot;We are
          deeply appreciative of the tremendously positive reception to Shastry
          Vs Shastry. The main goal of the movie is to clarify the complexities
          of family dynamics.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s encouraging to see how the story&apos;s universal themes,
          which explore the subtleties of interpersonal relationships and the
          forces that mold our lives, resonate with viewers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film&apos;s astounding success expands the director duo&apos;s
          already impressive body of work. Their most recent release,
          &quot;Raktabeej,&quot; which was made by Windows Productions, ended up
          becoming one of 2023&apos;s highest grossing films.

          We know that when two exceptionally talented people like Konkona
          Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee collaborate, the bar will be set
          extremely high. Thus, it is understandable that director Abhishek
          Chaubey is under pressure for the Netflix web series &quot;Killer
          Soup.&quot; It is &apos;very very loosely based on real-life
          events&apos;, as the makers claimed. So is this soup really as
          delicious as it sounds, or do the masalas go too far in this case?
          Let&apos;s investigate!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Konkona Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee film gets off to a great
          start. It centers on Manoj Bajpayee as Prabhakar, also known as Prabhu
          Shetty, and his spouse, Konkona Sensharma, as Swathi Shetty. Although
          Prabhu has been using his brother Arvind (Shayaji Shinde) as a means
          of money laundering, Swathi is solely concerned with refining her paya
          soup, which doesn&apos;t seem to be popular, and starting her own
          restaurant. Another character in the play is Umesh Pillai (played by
          Manoj Bajpayee again), who serves as both Swathi&apos;s paramour and
          Prabhu&apos;s masseuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          It starts out one way and then gets messy and complicated from there.
          Things happen (let&apos;s just settle for that, since saying anything
          more would give away the ending). What would this all lead to, and
          would Swathi be able to escape the scandal of money laundering and
          start her own restaurant? The program focuses on that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The series&apos; first two episodes are packed full of action.
          Actually, it seemed like everything was happening in these two
          episodes, so viewers&apos; biggest curiosity was what would be covered
          in the remaining six!
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the show doesn&apos;t get particularly dark, there are a number
          of twists and turns as the plot develops, leaving the audience curious
          about what will happen next. By the halfway point of the program, one
          could only wonder what more Chaubey could provide!
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s not necessarily a good thing. The show felt strained even
          after four episodes, and there were still roughly three hours and
          twenty minutes of content to cover. This made it unclear whether
          Chaubey would be able to maintain the momentum he had established. As
          a matter of fact, the third episode marks the slowdown in pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that everyone was nervous about what would happen next in the
          dark comedy is evidence that it is a skillfully written thriller. But
          there was a strange urgency about it. Chaubey&apos;s trademark
          eccentricity is present, though it doesn&apos;t always fully connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Konkana Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee are superb actors who also
          give faultless performances in &quot;Killer Soup.&quot; Still, there
          was a gap between the two; at least in the first four episodes, there
          was never much of a spark.
        </p>
        <p>
          The performers play their roles almost flawlessly, despite the fact
          that some characters—like the Khansama who has been teaching Swathi
          how to cook—are wildly exaggerated. Particularly striking was
          Nasser&apos;s portrayal of Hassan, a man driven by a personal tragedy
          to learn the truth about the events surrounding him.
        </p>
        <p>
          One noteworthy aspect of the show is how masterfully it has been shot.
          The story is given so much depth (and the soup&apos;s flavor) by the
          close-up shots. Because of the actors&apos; talent and ability to
          convey the right emotions to maximize impact, it only gets better.

          One of Mrunal Thakur&apos;s stories opens in a Mumbai hotel&apos;s
          restroom. The actor ran into a journalist colleague a few days prior
          to the release of her first movie, Love Sonia, in 2018 following a
          busy afternoon of media appearances. Even though Mrunal was already
          well-known from television, he admitted that he was anxious to move
          from television to the big screen, particularly with a strange film.
          She could have waited for a more secure solution, but the movie
          &quot;spoke&quot; to her, she claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is simple to chart the rise of Mrunal Thakur, the Marathi mulgi who
          has created a Telugu storm by following her heart even when it goes
          against industry conventions, six years and twelve films later.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a quiet but heartfelt diversion from labelling every new breakout
          female performer as its next big thing, the internet is presently
          raving about what Mrunal has accomplished in her latest Telugu
          romantic drama, Hi Nanna. The star of Shouryu&apos;s directorial
          debut, Hi Nanna (Hi Papa in Hindi), is Nani, whose resume is filled
          with successful performances in the genre. However, Mrunal&apos;s
          performance, which is genuinely endearing, anchors a large portion of
          the movie and keeps it cohesive even when the writing becomes forced,
          the climax is pushed, and an unnecessary dance number makes an
          appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          She debuted in an international feature film with good intentions,
          acted opposite Hrithik Roshan in her first mainstream Hindi movie, and
          then struggled with earnest but unsatisfactory projects before
          becoming a more formidable actor in Telugu films, which are in a
          language she wasn&apos;t born in. It is unfortunate that none of
          Mrunal&apos;s feature films in Hindi, even those directed by
          well-known names, have been able to provide her with the same platform
          and star presentation that her two Telugu releases, Hi Nanna and Sita
          Ramam, have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the camera adorses Mrunal in Sita Ramam and Hi Nanna makes it
          hard to look away. She joins the frame fifty minutes into the love
          drama in the former. A train coupe door gently opens as the
          compartment emerges from the shadows of a tunnel and Dulquer
          Salmaan&apos;s voice-over creates a legendary buzz about the woman he
          is going to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar scenes involving Mrunal and Nani enjoying a lovely moment on a
          Goa beach can also be found in Hi Nanna, where she has an almost
          hair-flip entrance scene. Without giving anything away, he is telling
          her what his wife looked like. The scene is made possible not only by
          Nani&apos;s performance, the dialogue, or the melodious background
          music, but also by Mrunal, who never stops gazing lovingly at him and
          allowing her eyes to be the only ones that speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is what sets her two South releases apart from a gaze trap
          that other actors have fallen victim to in the past. Although it may
          be a derogatory term, a lot of actors have previously allowed
          themselves to be reduced to something as simple as a
          &quot;flowerpot.&quot; These kinds of roles are astounding because
          they bring about enormous popularity and a devoted following. However,
          as history has shown us in a variety of industries, if one
          doesn&apos;t step outside of their comfort zone, the outcome is always
          the same: they begin to be replaced by the newest person, who is given
          the responsibility for such stock roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Female actors have rarely been given anything appetizing to chew on in
          A-list star vehicles, particularly in Tamil and Telugu. The women
          exist in the plot because the men do. However, that has been carefully
          avoided by Mrunal&apos;s decisions so far. Despite the fact that the
          stories are told from the perspectives of the men, the genre of
          romantic dramas, which includes both of her Telugu films, guarantees
          women substantially greater agency and narrative control. The women
          that Mrunal has in Sita Ramam as well as in Hi Nanna are necessary for
          the men to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrunal made an expected choice in her second Telugu film, the poignant
          and sensitive Hi Nanna. The actor had previously discussed how
          challenging it was to navigate her career after Sita Ramam. She said
          &quot;Indeed, it is difficult. There was a period of time when I
          signed no Telugu films at all. For me, having faith in a character and
          a story was crucial. After a year, I signed Hi Nanna because I thought
          the movie was great and I could relate to it. What&apos;s the point if
          I don&apos;t spend those 100 days anticipating something?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s not like Hi Nanna is a perfect movie; it has its share of
          flaws. It&apos;s overly sweet and rides on a resolute, almost
          optimistic sentimentality, but in the end, it all comes together
          because the movie is still largely sincere and gives Mrunal at least
          two memorable scenes to show off her range. Similar to Sita Ramam,
          particularly in the film&apos;s finale, Mrunal excels in the
          movie&apos;s slower moments, which appropriately heightens its intense
          emotional beats. Her roles have essentially proved that, despite
          Bollywood&apos;s lack of interest, the actor is capable of producing
          endearing dramas. Mrunal Thakur demonstrates that she represents the
          flower, not the flowerpot, with the help of Sita Ramam and Hi Nanna.

        </p>
        <p>
          Pathaan achieved a record-breaking opening weekend collection as a
          result. Pathaan had an opening box office collection of Rs 280.75 cr,
          according to Bollywood Hungama. With a staggering lifetime collection
          of Rs 543.05 cr in India and Rs 1050.3 cr worldwide, the movie—which
          also happened to be a landmark picture for Yash Raj Films—set a new
          record for box office receipts of Rs 1000 crore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The release was significant for Bollywood overall as well as for Shah
          Rukh&apos;s career. With the release of the Covid-19 lockdown, the
          superstar broke the negative trend and brought back Bollywood at the
          box office. Distributors and producers gained confidence from Pathaan
          to release high-budget movies, and many of them did well at the box
          office. While a number of films, including Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem
          Kahaani, OMG 2, Gadar 2, and Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, maintained the
          momentum at the box office, Shah Rukh made a triumphant comeback with
          Jawan, raising the stakes even further.

        <p>
          Shah Rukh not only returned to the action role in his first movie with
          Atlee, but he also played two roles. SRK shed all of his inhibitions

          as, playing the part of an identical father and son. Rajakumari&apos;s
          rap in honor of King Khan and Anirudh Ravichander&apos;s famous
          &quot;massy massy&quot; BGM elevated the movie to new heights and
          caused a massive explosion at the Box Office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jawan grossed an incredible Rs 75 cr on its opening day and Rs 286.16
          cr over the course of its four-day opening weekend. After just over
          two months at the Indian box office, Jawan brought in a staggering Rs
          1148.32 cr worldwide and Rs 643.87 cr in India over its lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before anyone could have predicted that we would see him in December,
          Shah Rukh shocked fans on Diwali by making an appearance in Tiger 3.
          His cameo, which he shared on screen with Salman Khan once more,
          became the talk of the town right away. The Diwali &quot;mithai&quot;
          was delicious, but Rajkumar Hirani and SRK&apos;s collaboration,
          Dunki, was the real Diwali-Christmas gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arriving in time for the holidays, the movie deviated from Shah
          Rukh&apos;s previous films in style. He lost his superstar aura in the
          movie, becoming just another Punjabi boy. His love for the nation and
          the people in it was greater, and that resonated with the audience,
          even though his love for Taapsee Pannu was a secondary plot in the
          movie. The movie turned out to be one of Shah Rukh&apos;s many hits.
          As of the time of reporting, the movie has brought in Rs 444.44 cr at
          the global box office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah Rukh&apos;s humility was brought to our attention by a number of
          Bollywood celebrities during the year through interviews,
          conversations, and social media posts, even though these three films
          solidified his position as the industry&apos;s most popular actor. Who
          could forget the incredibly popular selfie that Mona Singh took with
          him at his star-studded birthday party, or the fact that Vikram
          Kochhar, the star of Dunki, revealed that the superstar surprised him
          with a birthday party despite having a busy schedule during filming!
        </p>
        <p>
          Although 2023 will be remembered for a variety of reasons, Shah Rukh
          Khan&apos;s year will always be the most memorable. The actor will
          also begin 2024 on a high note as he will be featured in the 13th
          CNN-News18 Indian of the Year edition.

          They are reportedly planning to tie the knot next month, according to
          a News18 Telugu report, though this has not yet been confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans are certain that the couple is deeply in love and appears to be
          living together, even though they haven&apos;t made it official yet.
          Actor Ranbir Kapoor appears to have confirmed Vijay and
          Rashmika&apos;s romance, which has once again made headlines amid
          rumors and reports about their relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the Animal actor made his co-star blush when she answered
          a phone call from her purported boyfriend Vijay Devarakonda while they
          were promoting their upcoming movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with Rashmika Mandanna and Sandeep Reddy, Ranbir Kapoor promoted
          Animal on the popular show Unstoppable with NBK 2. The guests and the
          host struck up a lively discussion, with Vijay and Rashmika being
          teased about their romantic lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few of the show&apos;s videos, which highlight their amusing banter,
          are going viral on social media. Rashmika finally calls the actor
          after Ranbir begs her to call Vijay Deverakonda, teasing her by
          saying, &quot;He (Vijay) won&apos;t pick up Sandeep&apos;s
          phone.&quot; &quot;What&apos;s up with that?&quot; asked Vijay,
          putting a faint smile on Rashmika&apos;s countenance. She also told
          him that the phone was in speaker mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the conversation, Ranbir Kapoor made fun of the two of them,
          claiming that Balakrishnan was becoming envious of the call and
          that&apos;s why they&apos;ve been referring to her as
          &quot;Crushmika.&quot; The celebrity host questioned Vijay about his
          romantic partner, to which he replied, &quot;Bala sir loves
          Rashmika.&quot; When the Kushi actor declared, &quot;I love Sandeep
          Reddy Vanga,&quot; they were all in splits.

          Spears has previously stated that she will no longer be releasing her
          own music. Larry Rudolph, her longtime manager, resigned in July 2021,
          while she was still under the notorious conservatorship that ruled her
          life, finances, and voice for nearly 14 years. Rudolph stated that she
          had no plans to resume her profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that year, shortly after her conservatorship ended, she posted
          on Instagram expressing her fear of the music industry and her belief
          that not releasing her own songs was a sign of disobedience to her
          family.

          However, in 2022, she dropped the single &quot;Hold Me Closer,&quot; a
          joint effort with Elton John, which peaked at No. 6 and remained on
          the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 20 weeks. The single &quot;Mind Your
          Business,&quot; which featured will.i.am, was not included in the Hot
          100 and received negative reviews. 2016&apos;s &quot;Glory&quot; was
          Spears&apos; most recent full-length album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spears said in the Wednesday post that it was &quot;far from the

          Me,&quot; was published without her consent.

        Barroz, directed by and starring Mohanlal, is made in 3D, and it is the
        next big venture of the Malayalam star after Malaikottai Vaaliban.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal, who has spent decades as a household name in the Malayalam
        film industry, has chosen to take on the role of director for Barraoz,
        which is a movie adaption of Barroz: Guardian of D&apos;Gama&apos;s
        Treasure by Lijo Punnoose. The pandemic delayed the release of the
        movie, which had been first announced in 2019. Following a number of
        adjustments, such as Punnoose&apos;s departure from the project, Barroz
        appears to be nearing completion. Mohanlal has welcomed 2024 with a
        fresh movie poster as reassurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal is shown holding a sword and sitting on a hollow horse in the
        poster. He is as majestic as they come, and the legend of the horse
        piques curiosity and raises questions about the world of Barroz.
        <br />
        <br />
        Barroz&apos;s book is based on a legend regarding Vasco da Gama&apos;s
        treasure, who traveled through Kerala to reach India. Considering that
        the novel was written by Lijo Punnoose, the man behind the first 3D film
        in India, My Dear Kuttichathan (1984), one can anticipate a visually
        stunning and all-around family-friendly film.
        <br />
        <br />
        The film stars Pranav Mohanlal alongside Ignacio Mateos, Ceast Lorente
        Raton, Guru Somasundaram, and Komal Sharma. The film&apos;s soundtrack
        is being composed by South African composer Mark Kilian, while Lydian
        Nadharswaram is in charge of the songs.

        Rinku Dhawan and Neil Bhatt, two competitors, left the Bigg Boss 17
        house last night. Both of them, especially Rinku, who aimed to be
        impartial and least affected on the show, played the game with grace.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even about Munawar Faruqui&apos;s private life being dragged on the
        show, Rinku Dhawan expressed her opinions. &quot;Nobody deserves such a
        public trial, Munawar or anybody else,&quot; she declared. We must
        exercise tact. It&apos;s just wrong to publicly criticize others and
        make disparaging remarks. Munawar&apos;s problem was unnecessary and
        went too far.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku continued, &quot;Yes, Mannara is behind Munawar,&quot; in
        reference to Mannara Chopra and Ayesha Khan. I also informed her during
        the show that our friendship is only genuine until all the requirements
        are met. You have to start doubting that friendship the moment they
        don&apos;t. This implies that it is biased. I am unable to determine
        whether Ayesha has defamed Munawar because she has her own narrative,
        which he is not disputing. However, she could have waited since they
        both acknowledged that they were not committed, so yes, she picked the
        wrong moment and venue to apologize. Munawar could have handled it even
        then; she could have returned with the trophy after the show.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku Dhawan speaks out against the toxic masculinity that exists on the
        show, even though she is certain that Munawar will win the trophy.
        &quot;Abhishek&apos;s outbursts of rage at home are inappropriate. And
        no one speaks out against it. Munawar is harmful to himself and wrong to
        not deal with his circumstances and find closure. Vicky needs to make
        amends for his ability to playfully step on people&apos;s feelings in
        order to get ahead of them all.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku went on to say that there is no chance of reconciliation between
        Abhishek and Isha; in fact, she said of Vicky and Ankita&apos;s ongoing
        arguments, &quot;Vicky and Ankita are both strong personalities, so when
        they come on this big platform, they will clash.&quot;

        Bollywood star John Abraham recently bought an opulent bungalow in
        Mumbai&apos;s sought-after Khar neighborhood. With a price tag of Rs
        70.83 crore, the property is large, measuring 5,416 square feet. The
        actor also purchased the 7,722 square foot plot of land that the
        bungalow is located on.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the help of property registration documents that IndexTap.com was
        able to obtain, the deal was formally registered on December 27, 2023.
        Moneycontrol.com claims that John paid Rs 4.24 crore in stamp duty for
        the property.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abhraham&apos;s new residence is situated in the heart of
        Mumbai&apos;s lively residential area, on the Linking Road in Khar, one
        of the city&apos;s busiest shopping thoroughfares. In addition to its
        commercial significance, the area is well-known for being close to a
        number of educational institutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to space restrictions, Bollywood stars usually prefer to live
        vertically in upscale apartments; however, industry veterans are
        typically the ones who own the horizontal properties. Based on data
        gathered from the website, residential real estate in Khar is priced
        between Rs 40,000 and Rs 90,000 per square foot.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abraham&apos;s action comes in the wake of the recent publicity
        surrounding Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan, who made waves by giving
        his daughter Shweta Bachchan ownership of his Juhu-based bungalow,
        Prateeksha. The ownership transfer, valued at approximately Rs 50.63
        crore, was formalized on November 8 with the filing of two distinct gift
        deeds and the payment of Rs 50.65 lakh in stamp duty.
        <br />
        <br />
        John&apos;s most recent film appearance was in Pathaan, starring Shah
        Rukh Khan. In the movie, he portrayed an antagonist. John is working on
        several projects at the moment, such as Vedaa, Tariq, Tehran, and The
        Diplomat.

        Numerous sightings of Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan together have
        sparked rumors that they have been dating since 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        The actors Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan have long been the focus of
        dating rumors. This rumor started because of the photos where Ibrahim
        was spotted at Palak&apos;s house. The young actors haven&apos;t
        revealed their relationship to the public despite being frequently
        spotted together. But when they were spotted together last night on New
        Year&apos;s Eve, dating rumors were sparked. The focus of the video was
        Ibrahim&apos;s choice to keep his face hidden from the paparazzi.
        <br />
        <br />
        Palak Tiwari, the Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan actor, was spotted in a car
        with Ibrahim Ali Khan and another friend. However, when they saw the
        photographers, Sara Ali Khan&apos;s brother and Saif Ali Khan&apos;s son
        had an unexpected reaction. In the video, Ibrahim can be seen covering
        his face with his jacket. Rumors of a romantic relationship between
        Palak and Ibrahim date back to 2022. In fact, Shweta Tiwari&apos;s
        daughter Palak clarified in one of her interviews that Ibrahim is just a
        &quot;nice friend.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of her career, Palak is preparing to play herself in the film
        The Virgin Tree, which also features Mouni Roy and Sanjay Dutt. But
        Ibrahim will make his Bollywood debut in Sarzameen, which is also
        starring Kajol and is directed by Kayoze, Boman Irani&apos;s son.

        The excitement for Mammootty&apos;s upcoming film Bramayugam has
        increased as he has unveiled a new poster that features him in an avatar
        that has never been seen before, kicking off the year on a high note.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now that 2024 has arrived, Malayalam megastar Mammootty is set to rule
        the scene for an additional year, having captivated audiences in 2023
        with his compelling film selections and potent performances.
        <br />
        <br />
        The excitement for Mammootty&apos;s upcoming film Bramayugam has
        increased as he has unveiled a new poster that features him in an avatar
        that has never been seen before, kicking off the year on a high note.
        The most recent poster, which was unveiled a few months ago, is similar
        to the first look poster in that it features a monochromatic theme but
        presents the actor&apos;s character from a different angle.
        <br />
        <br />
        The new poster features Mammootty&apos;s character wearing a crown that
        looks like it was worn by those who practiced the ancient folk ritual
        art form of Theyyam. It also has makeup that suggests Mammootty is not
        your typical human, and it has attached horns. Bramayugam, directed by
        Rahul Sadasivan, who rose to fame with his first feature Bhoothakaalam,
        is a full-fledged horror movie with a strong historical setting in
        Kerala&apos;s dark ages. The movie&apos;s chilling premise is further
        highlighted by its tagline, &quot;the age of madness.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        With the release of the most recent poster, Mammootty wished all of his
        fans a happy New Year. Bramayugam, which was co-produced by Night Shift
        Studios and YNot Studios, also stars Shehnad Jalal as director of
        photography, Shafique Mohammed Ali as editor, and Christo Xavier as
        music composer. Notable roles are played by Arjun Ashokan, Sidharth
        Bharathan, and Amalda Liz.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;I am thrilled to be living the dream of directing the iconic
        Mammookka,&quot; Rahul declared at the beginning of the movie&apos;s
        production, which wrapped up in October. Bramayugam is a deeply felt
        tale that takes place in Kerala&apos;s dark ages, and I&apos;m happy
        that the producers are pushing the envelope to create an immersive
        cinematic experience. I hope fans of the genre everywhere as well as
        those of Mammookka will find it delightful.
        <br />
        <br />
        The precise release date of the movie is still unknown, despite
        unsubstantiated rumors that it will premiere in February. The film will
        be released in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi in addition to its
        original Malayalam version.
