          Actor Shehnaaz Gill made heads turn in a glitzy gold bustier blouse
          paired with a shimmering black sequin saree by designer Gaurav Gupta.
          She wore the striking cocktail-perfect ensemble to Ira Khan and Nupur
          Shikhare&apos;s star-studded wedding reception in Mumbai. While other
          celeb guests opted for traditional ethnic looks, Shehnaaz&apos;s
          modern saree twist was perfect for fashion-forward Indian women. Her
          gold bustier and embellished saree made for the ultimate party outfit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz shared photos of herself dressed in the Gaurav Gupta gold top
          and black sequin saree on Instagram. &quot;Gold & Glitter,&quot; she
          aptly captioned the post, earning praise from fans calling her a
          &quot;Golden Diva&quot; and &quot;Golden Girl of India.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The pre-draped saree featured dazzling gold diamantes embellishing the
          entire front, a ruffled pallu split into three floor-sweeping trains,
          ruffled pleats, ankle-grazing hem, and a figure-hugging cinched
          silhouette. She paired it with a gold bustier blouse having broad
          straps, shimmery beaded work, fitted bodice, plunging sweetheart
          neckline with front slit, and a curved super-cropped hem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping accessories minimal, Shehnaaz wore just a dainty gold bracelet
          and heels. Her glam picks included winged black eyeliner, golden eye
          shadow, feathered brows, glossy caramel lips, blushed cheeks, and
          highlighted contours. Flowing center-parted locks styled in
          well-defined curls completed her party-perfect look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz was last seen in the 2022 film Thank You For Coming, starring
          alongside Bhumi Pednekar, Dolly Singh, Kusha Kapila and Shibani Bedi.
          The movie also premiered at the 46th Toronto International Film
          Festival (TIFF) in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor frequently makes best-dressed lists for her experimental
          fashion choices spanning ethnic, fusion, casual and glamorous looks.
          Be it sarees, lehengas, gowns or corset designs, Shehnaaz carries both
          Indian and Western ensembles with flair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gold and black sequin Gaurav Gupta number gave a glitzy upgrade to
          the traditional saree. The sensual bustier styling with a saree draped
          around the waist created an alluring Indo-Western vibe. The
          embellished fabric, sultry palette and figure-hugging silhouette made
          it perfect for cocktail nights or receptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz proved sequins can work beautifully for evening ethnic wear,
          beyond just plain silks or chiffons. Her outfit gave inspiration for
          modern Indian women who want to give the saree a sexy twist. The
          plunging neckline, strappy sleeves, sequin work and cropped pallu gave
          traditional drapes a contemporary makeover.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor showed how fusion pairings like the bustier-saree can add
          drama and oomph for wedding functions and parties. While the black and
          gold color scheme lent a classical elegance, the shimmery
          embellishments and sensual styling gave it a glamorous edge.
          Shehnaaz&apos;s red carpet-worthy ensemble exemplified her
          experimental and confident sense of style.

              emblazoned with Kelce&apos;s name and number. Taking her seat next
              to Donna Kelce, Swift faced intense scrutiny after missing the
              Chiefs&apos; last game for the Golden Globes. But she silenced
              critics by not only attending but amping up the energy with her

              conflicts kept them apart. Eagle-eyed fans noticed Swift
              strategically placing her hand near her mouth, likely avoiding a
              viral moment à la Selena Gomez at the Globes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earlier, Donna had said she would be in the heated skybox despite
              below-freezing winds and temperatures plunging to -27°C. &quot;I
              have to have a blanket and I’ll have my winter coat on,&quot; she
              stated. This was Swift&apos;s 5th Chiefs game out of 6 at
              Arrowhead Stadium. She told Time Magazine, &quot;By the time I
              went to that first game, we were a couple.&quot; Swift added they
              would never “hard launch a first date” at a game.

        <p>
          Sharad Kelkar, one of the most recognizable voices in Bollywood,
          recently discussed his experiences dubbing for South Indian films. He
          is known for voicing Prabhas&apos; characters in the Hindi dubbed
          versions of films like Baahubali and Salaar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar shared that he used to stammer as a child and never imagined he
          would become an actor or voice actor. On dubbing for South films, he
          said the recognition he got for voicing Prabhas was immense, unlike
          anything seen before in the voicing industry. He noted how audiences
          now notice the voice artists, like Shreyas Talpade in Pushpa and
          Sachin Gole for Yash in KGF.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Kelkar, Baahubali brought about this change and made
          people recognize and respect voice actors. He wants filmmakers to
          start crediting voice actors in movie posters and end credits, like
          it&apos;s done in Hollywood animated films. He feels voice actors in
          India don&apos;t get their due.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussing overcoming his stammering, Kelkar shared that correcting
          his breathing pattern helped stop his stammering. People started
          noticing his voice after that. To improve his voice modulation, he
          observed other actors&apos; dialogue delivery. Once the stammering
          reduced, he learned the craft of dubbing from coach Mona Shetty.
          Starting with small projects, his big break was Baahubali.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar&apos;s next voice acting project is Hotstar&apos;s animated
          series The Legend of Hanuman, where he has voiced Ravana. He chooses
          projects based on the writing. He wanted to break the cliche and
          present a new perspective on Ravana. As an actor, voicing mythological
          characters allows exploring them in new ways. Overall, Kelkar wants
          writers to get more recognition in India for their critical
          contribution.

          Mahesh Babu’s highly anticipated return to screens after two years in
          the Trivikram Srinivas-directorial ‘SSMB28’, titled ‘Guntur Kaaram’,
          has received a roaring response on its opening day. According to early
          estimates by trade website Sacnilk, the film has collected a gross of
          Rs 50 crore on day one, reflecting Mahesh Babu’s star power.
        </p>
        <p>
          As expected, the lion’s share of the collection for ‘Guntur Kaaram’
          came from the Telugu superstar’s stronghold of Andhra Pradesh and
          Telangana. The estimated gross from the Telugu territories was
          approximately Rs 44.5 crore. This was followed by Karnataka with Rs
          4.5 crore gross, Tamil Nadu with Rs 0.5 crore and Rs 0.5 crore from
          other parts of India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other major release this Friday was Teja Sajja and director
          Prasanth Varma’s pan-India sci-fi fantasy ‘HanuMan’. Despite positive
          reviews, the film had a more subdued opening day compared to ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’. The total day one net collection for ‘HanuMan’ across all
          languages was Rs 7.56 crore as per estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this, the majority Rs 5.5 crore net came from the Telugu version.
          The Hindi dubbed version contributed Rs 2 crore, while other languages
          chipped in with Rs 0.06 crore. However, the unique genre and
          word-of-mouth are expected to attract the family audience, especially
          in the Hindi belt where there is a dearth of major releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first weekend remains crucial for both ‘Guntur Kaaram’ and
          ‘HanuMan’ as the Sankranti weekend will see other big Telugu releases
          like Venkatesh’s ‘Saindhav’ and Nagarjuna’s ‘NaanSamruddha’ competing
          for screens and audiences. Trade pundits had predicted Mahesh Babu’s
          film will dominate over the Sankranti releases due to his stardom. It
          remains to be seen if the box office dynamics change as more films
          open.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Trivikram Srinivas, known for several blockbusters, ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’ marks an attempt to deliver a hit after his previous film ‘Ala
          Vaikunthapurramuloo’. Mahesh Babu was last seen in the 2020
          blockbuster ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’. Hence, the combination of the star
          actor and popular director has generated immense buzz among fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Guntur Kaaram’ features Mahesh Babu in the role of an archaeologist
          on a treasure hunt. Pooja Hegde stars as the female lead, while the
          cast includes Jayaram, Sachin Khedekar, and others. The story blends
          comedy, adventure, and supernatural elements against the backdrop of
          Guntur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film’s release in theaters coinciding with the Sankranti festival
          weekend gives it the advantage of attracting big crowds. Moreover,
          Mahesh Babu has a huge fan following across the Telugu states who
          eagerly await his films on the big screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Covid pandemic impacting the entertainment industry over the
          past two years, the response to ‘Guntur Kaaram’ indicates that
          audiences are flocking back to theaters when major stars like Mahesh
          Babu deliver a promising film.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the film sustains its collections over the extended opening week
          and positive word-of-mouth, it is headed towards becoming a huge hit.
          Not just in the Telugu belt, but even markets like Karnataka, Tamil
          Nadu, and Hindi circuits hold potential if content clicks with a wide
          appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Telugu film industry, the success of ‘Guntur Kaaram’ will
          provide a major boost after a difficult pandemic period. And for
          Mahesh Babu, it will cement his standing as one of Tollywood’s most
          bankable superstars with an enviable box office track record.

          In the latest eviction twist, contestant Samarth Jurel has reportedly
          been eliminated from the popular reality show Bigg Boss 17 just ahead
          of the grand finale this month.

          Nandita Roy and Shiboprosad Mukherjee expressed their thoughts on the
          film&apos;s ongoing success in a joint statement, saying, &quot;We are
          deeply appreciative of the tremendously positive reception to Shastry

          of family dynamics.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s encouraging to see how the story&apos;s universal themes,
          which explore the subtleties of interpersonal relationships and the
          forces that mold our lives, resonate with viewers.

          The film&apos;s astounding success expands the director duo&apos;s
          already impressive body of work. Their most recent release,

          We know that when two exceptionally talented people like Konkona
          Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee collaborate, the bar will be set
          extremely high. Thus, it is understandable that director Abhishek
          Chaubey is under pressure for the Netflix web series &quot;Killer
          Soup.&quot; It is &apos;very very loosely based on real-life
          events&apos;, as the makers claimed. So is this soup really as
          delicious as it sounds, or do the masalas go too far in this case?
          Let&apos;s investigate!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Konkona Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee film gets off to a great
          start. It centers on Manoj Bajpayee as Prabhakar, also known as Prabhu
          Shetty, and his spouse, Konkona Sensharma, as Swathi Shetty. Although
          Prabhu has been using his brother Arvind (Shayaji Shinde) as a means
          of money laundering, Swathi is solely concerned with refining her paya
          soup, which doesn&apos;t seem to be popular, and starting her own
          restaurant. Another character in the play is Umesh Pillai (played by
          Manoj Bajpayee again), who serves as both Swathi&apos;s paramour and
          Prabhu&apos;s masseuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          It starts out one way and then gets messy and complicated from there.
          Things happen (let&apos;s just settle for that, since saying anything
          more would give away the ending). What would this all lead to, and
          would Swathi be able to escape the scandal of money laundering and
          start her own restaurant? The program focuses on that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The series&apos; first two episodes are packed full of action.
          Actually, it seemed like everything was happening in these two
          episodes, so viewers&apos; biggest curiosity was what would be covered
          in the remaining six!
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the show doesn&apos;t get particularly dark, there are a number
          of twists and turns as the plot develops, leaving the audience curious
          about what will happen next. By the halfway point of the program, one
          could only wonder what more Chaubey could provide!
        </p>
        <p>
          That&apos;s not necessarily a good thing. The show felt strained even
          after four episodes, and there were still roughly three hours and
          twenty minutes of content to cover. This made it unclear whether
          Chaubey would be able to maintain the momentum he had established. As
          a matter of fact, the third episode marks the slowdown in pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that everyone was nervous about what would happen next in the
          dark comedy is evidence that it is a skillfully written thriller. But
          there was a strange urgency about it. Chaubey&apos;s trademark
          eccentricity is present, though it doesn&apos;t always fully connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Konkana Sensharma and Manoj Bajpayee are superb actors who also
          give faultless performances in &quot;Killer Soup.&quot; Still, there
          was a gap between the two; at least in the first four episodes, there
          was never much of a spark.
        </p>
        <p>
          The performers play their roles almost flawlessly, despite the fact
          that some characters—like the Khansama who has been teaching Swathi
          how to cook—are wildly exaggerated. Particularly striking was
          Nasser&apos;s portrayal of Hassan, a man driven by a personal tragedy
          to learn the truth about the events surrounding him.
        </p>
        <p>
          One noteworthy aspect of the show is how masterfully it has been shot.
          The story is given so much depth (and the soup&apos;s flavor) by the
          close-up shots. Because of the actors&apos; talent and ability to
          convey the right emotions to maximize impact, it only gets better.

          One of Mrunal Thakur&apos;s stories opens in a Mumbai hotel&apos;s
          restroom. The actor ran into a journalist colleague a few days prior
          to the release of her first movie, Love Sonia, in 2018 following a
          busy afternoon of media appearances. Even though Mrunal was already
          well-known from television, he admitted that he was anxious to move
          from television to the big screen, particularly with a strange film.
          She could have waited for a more secure solution, but the movie
          &quot;spoke&quot; to her, she claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is simple to chart the rise of Mrunal Thakur, the Marathi mulgi who
          has created a Telugu storm by following her heart even when it goes
          against industry conventions, six years and twelve films later.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a quiet but heartfelt diversion from labelling every new breakout
          female performer as its next big thing, the internet is presently
          raving about what Mrunal has accomplished in her latest Telugu
          romantic drama, Hi Nanna. The star of Shouryu&apos;s directorial
          debut, Hi Nanna (Hi Papa in Hindi), is Nani, whose resume is filled
          with successful performances in the genre. However, Mrunal&apos;s
          performance, which is genuinely endearing, anchors a large portion of
          the movie and keeps it cohesive even when the writing becomes forced,
          the climax is pushed, and an unnecessary dance number makes an
          appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          She debuted in an international feature film with good intentions,
          acted opposite Hrithik Roshan in her first mainstream Hindi movie, and
          then struggled with earnest but unsatisfactory projects before
          becoming a more formidable actor in Telugu films, which are in a
          language she wasn&apos;t born in. It is unfortunate that none of
          Mrunal&apos;s feature films in Hindi, even those directed by
          well-known names, have been able to provide her with the same platform
          and star presentation that her two Telugu releases, Hi Nanna and Sita
          Ramam, have.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the camera adorses Mrunal in Sita Ramam and Hi Nanna makes it
          hard to look away. She joins the frame fifty minutes into the love
          drama in the former. A train coupe door gently opens as the
          compartment emerges from the shadows of a tunnel and Dulquer
          Salmaan&apos;s voice-over creates a legendary buzz about the woman he
          is going to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar scenes involving Mrunal and Nani enjoying a lovely moment on a
          Goa beach can also be found in Hi Nanna, where she has an almost
          hair-flip entrance scene. Without giving anything away, he is telling
          her what his wife looked like. The scene is made possible not only by
          Nani&apos;s performance, the dialogue, or the melodious background
          music, but also by Mrunal, who never stops gazing lovingly at him and
          allowing her eyes to be the only ones that speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is what sets her two South releases apart from a gaze trap
          that other actors have fallen victim to in the past. Although it may
          be a derogatory term, a lot of actors have previously allowed
          themselves to be reduced to something as simple as a
          &quot;flowerpot.&quot; These kinds of roles are astounding because
          they bring about enormous popularity and a devoted following. However,
          as history has shown us in a variety of industries, if one
          doesn&apos;t step outside of their comfort zone, the outcome is always
          the same: they begin to be replaced by the newest person, who is given
          the responsibility for such stock roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Female actors have rarely been given anything appetizing to chew on in
          A-list star vehicles, particularly in Tamil and Telugu. The women
          exist in the plot because the men do. However, that has been carefully
          avoided by Mrunal&apos;s decisions so far. Despite the fact that the
          stories are told from the perspectives of the men, the genre of
          romantic dramas, which includes both of her Telugu films, guarantees
          women substantially greater agency and narrative control. The women
          that Mrunal has in Sita Ramam as well as in Hi Nanna are necessary for
          the men to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mrunal made an expected choice in her second Telugu film, the poignant
          and sensitive Hi Nanna. The actor had previously discussed how
          challenging it was to navigate her career after Sita Ramam. She said
          &quot;Indeed, it is difficult. There was a period of time when I
          signed no Telugu films at all. For me, having faith in a character and
          a story was crucial. After a year, I signed Hi Nanna because I thought
          the movie was great and I could relate to it. What&apos;s the point if
          I don&apos;t spend those 100 days anticipating something?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s not like Hi Nanna is a perfect movie; it has its share of
          flaws. It&apos;s overly sweet and rides on a resolute, almost
          optimistic sentimentality, but in the end, it all comes together
          because the movie is still largely sincere and gives Mrunal at least
          two memorable scenes to show off her range. Similar to Sita Ramam,
          particularly in the film&apos;s finale, Mrunal excels in the
          movie&apos;s slower moments, which appropriately heightens its intense
          emotional beats. Her roles have essentially proved that, despite
          Bollywood&apos;s lack of interest, the actor is capable of producing
          endearing dramas. Mrunal Thakur demonstrates that she represents the
          flower, not the flowerpot, with the help of Sita Ramam and Hi Nanna.

          Pathaan achieved a record-breaking opening weekend collection as a
          result. Pathaan had an opening box office collection of Rs 280.75 cr,
          according to Bollywood Hungama. With a staggering lifetime collection
          of Rs 543.05 cr in India and Rs 1050.3 cr worldwide, the movie—which
          also happened to be a landmark picture for Yash Raj Films—set a new
          record for box office receipts of Rs 1000 crore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The release was significant for Bollywood overall as well as for Shah
          Rukh&apos;s career. With the release of the Covid-19 lockdown, the
          superstar broke the negative trend and brought back Bollywood at the
          box office. Distributors and producers gained confidence from Pathaan
          to release high-budget movies, and many of them did well at the box
          office. While a number of films, including Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem
          Kahaani, OMG 2, Gadar 2, and Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, maintained the
          momentum at the box office, Shah Rukh made a triumphant comeback with
          Jawan, raising the stakes even further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah Rukh not only returned to the action role in his first movie with
          Atlee, but he also played two roles. SRK shed all of his inhibitions
          and transformed into the bulky hero we had all been waiting to see him
          as, playing the part of an identical father and son. Rajakumari&apos;s
          rap in honor of King Khan and Anirudh Ravichander&apos;s famous
          &quot;massy massy&quot; BGM elevated the movie to new heights and
          caused a massive explosion at the Box Office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jawan grossed an incredible Rs 75 cr on its opening day and Rs 286.16
          cr over the course of its four-day opening weekend. After just over
          two months at the Indian box office, Jawan brought in a staggering Rs
          1148.32 cr worldwide and Rs 643.87 cr in India over its lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before anyone could have predicted that we would see him in December,
          Shah Rukh shocked fans on Diwali by making an appearance in Tiger 3.
          His cameo, which he shared on screen with Salman Khan once more,
          became the talk of the town right away. The Diwali &quot;mithai&quot;
          was delicious, but Rajkumar Hirani and SRK&apos;s collaboration,
          Dunki, was the real Diwali-Christmas gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arriving in time for the holidays, the movie deviated from Shah
          Rukh&apos;s previous films in style. He lost his superstar aura in the
          movie, becoming just another Punjabi boy. His love for the nation and
          the people in it was greater, and that resonated with the audience,
          even though his love for Taapsee Pannu was a secondary plot in the
          movie. The movie turned out to be one of Shah Rukh&apos;s many hits.
          As of the time of reporting, the movie has brought in Rs 444.44 cr at
          the global box office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah Rukh&apos;s humility was brought to our attention by a number of
          Bollywood celebrities during the year through interviews,
          conversations, and social media posts, even though these three films
          solidified his position as the industry&apos;s most popular actor. Who
          could forget the incredibly popular selfie that Mona Singh took with
          him at his star-studded birthday party, or the fact that Vikram
          Kochhar, the star of Dunki, revealed that the superstar surprised him
          with a birthday party despite having a busy schedule during filming!
        </p>
        <p>
          Although 2023 will be remembered for a variety of reasons, Shah Rukh
          Khan&apos;s year will always be the most memorable. The actor will
          also begin 2024 on a high note as he will be featured in the 13th
          CNN-News18 Indian of the Year edition.

          They are reportedly planning to tie the knot next month, according to
          a News18 Telugu report, though this has not yet been confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans are certain that the couple is deeply in love and appears to be
          living together, even though they haven&apos;t made it official yet.
          Actor Ranbir Kapoor appears to have confirmed Vijay and
          Rashmika&apos;s romance, which has once again made headlines amid
          rumors and reports about their relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the Animal actor made his co-star blush when she answered
          a phone call from her purported boyfriend Vijay Devarakonda while they
          were promoting their upcoming movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with Rashmika Mandanna and Sandeep Reddy, Ranbir Kapoor promoted
          Animal on the popular show Unstoppable with NBK 2. The guests and the
          host struck up a lively discussion, with Vijay and Rashmika being
          teased about their romantic lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few of the show&apos;s videos, which highlight their amusing banter,
          are going viral on social media. Rashmika finally calls the actor
          after Ranbir begs her to call Vijay Deverakonda, teasing her by
          saying, &quot;He (Vijay) won&apos;t pick up Sandeep&apos;s
          phone.&quot; &quot;What&apos;s up with that?&quot; asked Vijay,
          putting a faint smile on Rashmika&apos;s countenance. She also told
          him that the phone was in speaker mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the conversation, Ranbir Kapoor made fun of the two of them,
          claiming that Balakrishnan was becoming envious of the call and
          that&apos;s why they&apos;ve been referring to her as
          &quot;Crushmika.&quot; The celebrity host questioned Vijay about his
          romantic partner, to which he replied, &quot;Bala sir loves
          Rashmika.&quot; When the Kushi actor declared, &quot;I love Sandeep
          Reddy Vanga,&quot; they were all in splits.

          Spears has previously stated that she will no longer be releasing her
          own music. Larry Rudolph, her longtime manager, resigned in July 2021,
          while she was still under the notorious conservatorship that ruled her
          life, finances, and voice for nearly 14 years. Rudolph stated that she
          had no plans to resume her profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that year, shortly after her conservatorship ended, she posted
          on Instagram expressing her fear of the music industry and her belief
          that not releasing her own songs was a sign of disobedience to her
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in 2022, she dropped the single &quot;Hold Me Closer,&quot; a
          joint effort with Elton John, which peaked at No. 6 and remained on
          the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 20 weeks. The single &quot;Mind Your
          Business,&quot; which featured will.i.am, was not included in the Hot
          100 and received negative reviews. 2016&apos;s &quot;Glory&quot; was
          Spears&apos; most recent full-length album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spears said in the Wednesday post that it was &quot;far from the
          truth&quot; that her best-selling memoir from 2023, &quot;The Woman In
          Me,&quot; was published without her consent.

        Barroz, directed by and starring Mohanlal, is made in 3D, and it is the
        next big venture of the Malayalam star after Malaikottai Vaaliban.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal, who has spent decades as a household name in the Malayalam
        film industry, has chosen to take on the role of director for Barraoz,
        which is a movie adaption of Barroz: Guardian of D&apos;Gama&apos;s
        Treasure by Lijo Punnoose. The pandemic delayed the release of the
        movie, which had been first announced in 2019. Following a number of
        adjustments, such as Punnoose&apos;s departure from the project, Barroz
        appears to be nearing completion. Mohanlal has welcomed 2024 with a
        fresh movie poster as reassurance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mohanlal is shown holding a sword and sitting on a hollow horse in the
        poster. He is as majestic as they come, and the legend of the horse
        piques curiosity and raises questions about the world of Barroz.
        <br />
        <br />
        Barroz&apos;s book is based on a legend regarding Vasco da Gama&apos;s
        treasure, who traveled through Kerala to reach India. Considering that
        the novel was written by Lijo Punnoose, the man behind the first 3D film
        in India, My Dear Kuttichathan (1984), one can anticipate a visually
        stunning and all-around family-friendly film.
        <br />
        <br />
        The film stars Pranav Mohanlal alongside Ignacio Mateos, Ceast Lorente
        Raton, Guru Somasundaram, and Komal Sharma. The film&apos;s soundtrack
        is being composed by South African composer Mark Kilian, while Lydian
        Nadharswaram is in charge of the songs.

        Rinku Dhawan and Neil Bhatt, two competitors, left the Bigg Boss 17
        house last night. Both of them, especially Rinku, who aimed to be
        impartial and least affected on the show, played the game with grace.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even about Munawar Faruqui&apos;s private life being dragged on the
        show, Rinku Dhawan expressed her opinions. &quot;Nobody deserves such a
        public trial, Munawar or anybody else,&quot; she declared. We must
        exercise tact. It&apos;s just wrong to publicly criticize others and
        make disparaging remarks. Munawar&apos;s problem was unnecessary and
        went too far.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku continued, &quot;Yes, Mannara is behind Munawar,&quot; in
        reference to Mannara Chopra and Ayesha Khan. I also informed her during
        the show that our friendship is only genuine until all the requirements
        are met. You have to start doubting that friendship the moment they
        don&apos;t. This implies that it is biased. I am unable to determine
        whether Ayesha has defamed Munawar because she has her own narrative,
        which he is not disputing. However, she could have waited since they
        both acknowledged that they were not committed, so yes, she picked the
        wrong moment and venue to apologize. Munawar could have handled it even
        then; she could have returned with the trophy after the show.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku Dhawan speaks out against the toxic masculinity that exists on the
        show, even though she is certain that Munawar will win the trophy.
        &quot;Abhishek&apos;s outbursts of rage at home are inappropriate. And
        no one speaks out against it. Munawar is harmful to himself and wrong to
        not deal with his circumstances and find closure. Vicky needs to make
        amends for his ability to playfully step on people&apos;s feelings in
        order to get ahead of them all.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rinku went on to say that there is no chance of reconciliation between
        Abhishek and Isha; in fact, she said of Vicky and Ankita&apos;s ongoing
        arguments, &quot;Vicky and Ankita are both strong personalities, so when
        they come on this big platform, they will clash.&quot;

        Bollywood star John Abraham recently bought an opulent bungalow in
        Mumbai&apos;s sought-after Khar neighborhood. With a price tag of Rs
        70.83 crore, the property is large, measuring 5,416 square feet. The
        actor also purchased the 7,722 square foot plot of land that the
        bungalow is located on.
        <br />
        <br />
        With the help of property registration documents that IndexTap.com was
        able to obtain, the deal was formally registered on December 27, 2023.
        Moneycontrol.com claims that John paid Rs 4.24 crore in stamp duty for
        the property.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abhraham&apos;s new residence is situated in the heart of
        Mumbai&apos;s lively residential area, on the Linking Road in Khar, one
        of the city&apos;s busiest shopping thoroughfares. In addition to its
        commercial significance, the area is well-known for being close to a
        number of educational institutions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to space restrictions, Bollywood stars usually prefer to live
        vertically in upscale apartments; however, industry veterans are
        typically the ones who own the horizontal properties. Based on data
        gathered from the website, residential real estate in Khar is priced
        between Rs 40,000 and Rs 90,000 per square foot.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Abraham&apos;s action comes in the wake of the recent publicity
        surrounding Bollywood icon Amitabh Bachchan, who made waves by giving
        his daughter Shweta Bachchan ownership of his Juhu-based bungalow,
        Prateeksha. The ownership transfer, valued at approximately Rs 50.63
        crore, was formalized on November 8 with the filing of two distinct gift
        deeds and the payment of Rs 50.65 lakh in stamp duty.
        <br />
        <br />
        John&apos;s most recent film appearance was in Pathaan, starring Shah
        Rukh Khan. In the movie, he portrayed an antagonist. John is working on
        several projects at the moment, such as Vedaa, Tariq, Tehran, and The
        Diplomat.

        Numerous sightings of Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan together have
        sparked rumors that they have been dating since 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        The actors Palak Tiwari and Ibrahim Ali Khan have long been the focus of
        dating rumors. This rumor started because of the photos where Ibrahim
        was spotted at Palak&apos;s house. The young actors haven&apos;t
        revealed their relationship to the public despite being frequently
        spotted together. But when they were spotted together last night on New
        Year&apos;s Eve, dating rumors were sparked. The focus of the video was
        Ibrahim&apos;s choice to keep his face hidden from the paparazzi.
        <br />
        <br />
        Palak Tiwari, the Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan actor, was spotted in a car
        with Ibrahim Ali Khan and another friend. However, when they saw the
        photographers, Sara Ali Khan&apos;s brother and Saif Ali Khan&apos;s son
        had an unexpected reaction. In the video, Ibrahim can be seen covering
        his face with his jacket. Rumors of a romantic relationship between
        Palak and Ibrahim date back to 2022. In fact, Shweta Tiwari&apos;s
        daughter Palak clarified in one of her interviews that Ibrahim is just a
        &quot;nice friend.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        In terms of her career, Palak is preparing to play herself in the film
        The Virgin Tree, which also features Mouni Roy and Sanjay Dutt. But
        Ibrahim will make his Bollywood debut in Sarzameen, which is also
        starring Kajol and is directed by Kayoze, Boman Irani&apos;s son.

        The excitement for Mammootty&apos;s upcoming film Bramayugam has
        increased as he has unveiled a new poster that features him in an avatar
        that has never been seen before, kicking off the year on a high note.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now that 2024 has arrived, Malayalam megastar Mammootty is set to rule
        the scene for an additional year, having captivated audiences in 2023
        with his compelling film selections and potent performances.
        <br />
        <br />
        The excitement for Mammootty&apos;s upcoming film Bramayugam has
        increased as he has unveiled a new poster that features him in an avatar
        that has never been seen before, kicking off the year on a high note.
        The most recent poster, which was unveiled a few months ago, is similar
        to the first look poster in that it features a monochromatic theme but
        presents the actor&apos;s character from a different angle.
        <br />
        <br />
        The new poster features Mammootty&apos;s character wearing a crown that
        looks like it was worn by those who practiced the ancient folk ritual
        art form of Theyyam. It also has makeup that suggests Mammootty is not
        your typical human, and it has attached horns. Bramayugam, directed by
        Rahul Sadasivan, who rose to fame with his first feature Bhoothakaalam,
        is a full-fledged horror movie with a strong historical setting in
        Kerala&apos;s dark ages. The movie&apos;s chilling premise is further
        highlighted by its tagline, &quot;the age of madness.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        With the release of the most recent poster, Mammootty wished all of his
        fans a happy New Year. Bramayugam, which was co-produced by Night Shift
        Studios and YNot Studios, also stars Shehnad Jalal as director of
        photography, Shafique Mohammed Ali as editor, and Christo Xavier as
        music composer. Notable roles are played by Arjun Ashokan, Sidharth
        Bharathan, and Amalda Liz.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;I am thrilled to be living the dream of directing the iconic
        Mammookka,&quot; Rahul declared at the beginning of the movie&apos;s
        production, which wrapped up in October. Bramayugam is a deeply felt
        tale that takes place in Kerala&apos;s dark ages, and I&apos;m happy
        that the producers are pushing the envelope to create an immersive
        cinematic experience. I hope fans of the genre everywhere as well as
        those of Mammookka will find it delightful.
        <br />
        <br />
        The precise release date of the movie is still unknown, despite
        unsubstantiated rumors that it will premiere in February. The film will
        be released in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Hindi in addition to its
        original Malayalam version.
