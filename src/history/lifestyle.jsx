          Spider silk possesses incredible properties that make it highly
          desirable for various applications. It has immense strength,
          elasticity, and flexibility exceeding steel and Kevlar. Orb weaver
          spiders can spin massive strong webs up to 1.5 meters wide that can
          trap birds. If harnessed at scale, spider silk could transform fields
          like medicine, defense, textiles and aerospace.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, spiders are nearly impossible to farm at a large scale due to
          their volatile nature. They frequently attack and eat each other when
          kept together, as per spider silk expert Aarathi Prasad. This
          limitation has stymied utilizing spider silk through history despite
          its virtues. But now scientists aim to produce it without relying on
          spiders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, researchers in China modified silkworms&apos; DNA using
          CRISPR gene editing to generate spider silk. The resulting silk had
          strength and elasticity approximating natural spider silk. This was a
          marked improvement over past approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, scientists at Utah State University earlier tried
          extracting spider silk protein from the milk of genetically engineered
          goats. But the silk fibers were weak. The goats now live on a
          university farm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previous artificial spider silk made in labs also lacked the
          protective glycoprotein coating spiders apply on their webs. Silkworms
          have an innate gland for secreting such coating, giving them an
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Prasad notes even silkworm spider silk can&apos;t perfectly
          replicate natural spider silk. In spiders, silk starts liquid before
          solidifying into threads. We don&apos;t fully understand this natural
          protein folding process that imparts strength. So silkworm silk will
          always be part spider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donghua University is working to get closer by tweaking the silkworm
          silk&apos;s molecular structure for more strength and elasticity. They
          highlight an existing robust silk supply chain for silkworms that
          allows scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to produce spider silk without spiders has exciting
          potential if the properties can be fine-tuned. The materials could
          replace plastics in some single-use products, given spider silk is
          biodegradable. Spider silk is also hypoallergenic, meaning medical
          devices and sutures made from it would not cause reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spider silk could have applications in bulletproof vests, parachute
          cords, artificial tendons, and even space suits owing to its
          durability and lightness. It could reinforce airplane panels and
          suspensions bridges. The biocompatibility opens up possibilities in
          tissue engineering as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, scaling up artificial spider silk does raise ecological
          concerns. Introducing genetically engineered silkworms or goats in the
          wild could impact natural populations and ecosystems. Tight regulation
          around their use in closed facilities would be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also ethical dilemmas regarding animal gene editing that
          require careful consideration. While spider silk production has
          benefits, it should not come at the cost of animal welfare or
          conservation. Striking the right balance will be key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The field does show how biotechnology can provide solutions where
          nature poses challenges. But replicating the complex marvel of
          evolution requires nuance. Artificial spider silk may find uses where
          natural silk isn&apos;t viable, but it seems unlikely to completely
          replace real spider silk. There are limits to bioengineering the
          intricate biological processes still being unravelled.

          her plate, which featured a protein-rich scrambled egg, green moong
          dal, jowar roti, and a leafy vegetable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rakul stated in the Instagram story that &quot;balance is the
          key.&quot; A well-balanced diet is essential for preserving general
          health and wellness. It aids in providing vital energy, vitamins,
          minerals, and nutrients that the body needs to function at its best.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;A balanced diet primarily makes sure the body gets enough of the
          macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The main source of
          energy for both physical activity and bodily processes is
          carbohydrates. Proteins maintain muscle mass, aid in tissue repair,
          and promote growth. The production of hormones, nutrient absorption,
          and cell function all depend on healthy fats,&quot; according to
          Ruchika Jain, chief clinical nutritionist at Fortis Hospital in Vasant
          Kunj.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-rounded diet places a strong emphasis on eating a variety of
          fruits and vegetables, which offer a wealth of vitamins, minerals, and
          antioxidants that are essential for strengthening the immune system,
          fending off infections, and lowering the risk of chronic conditions
          like diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Fibre, which is abundant in fruits, vegetables, and whole
          grains, helps with weight management and lowers the risk of obesity by
          promoting fullness, preventing constipation, and facilitating
          digestion,&quot; according to Jain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintaining a healthy weight and general health requires a balance
          between caloric intake and expenditure. Overindulging in calories can
          result in weight gain and associated health problems, while
          underconsuming calories can cause deficiencies and malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Jain, getting enough water is important for many body
          processes, such as metabolism and the removal of toxins.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-balanced diet promotes mental health, claims Jain. Jain stated,
          &quot;Important nutrients like Omega-3 fatty acids, which are present
          in nuts and fish, have been linked to improved cognitive function and
          reduced risk of depression.&quot; Nuts, flax seeds, chia seeds,
          salmon, and other well-known sources are among the others that you
          should include in your diet.

          Winter is the season to gather colorful, flavorful, and in-season
          fruits and vegetables. Green peas are a winter vegetable that people
          all over the world love. These green pods are a fantastic source of
          different vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber in addition to being
          loaded with antioxidants. Whether consumed raw during harvest or
          frozen, green peas have earned a reputation as a popular and adaptable
          component in cuisines all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&apos;s investigate ways to keep green peas fresher at home so we
          can eat them practically all year round!

            Ananya Chowdhury, a software engineer, gardener, and enthusiast from
            Pune, shared the following tips:
          </span>
          <ul className="space-y-1.5 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Start by removing the peas from their pods and throwing away any
              that are damaged or discolored.
            </li>
            <li>
              The blanching process comes next. Using a strainer or a blanching
              basket, blanch those peas in boiling water for one to two minutes.
              Subsequently, quickly place them in an ice bath. This procedure
              preserves its maximum nutritional value in addition to preserving
              its vivid green color. According to Chowdhury, blanching is
              crucial for inactivating enzymes and lowering the microbial load
              on the peas, which minimizes the chance of bacterial or microbial
              growth during storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              After they&apos;ve cooled, pat them dry with a fresh paper towel
              or kitchen towel.
            </li>
            <li>
              These peas can now be kept in freezer-safe containers, heavy-duty
              freezer bags, or airtight zip-lock bags. Before packaging, it is
              advised to portion the peas into individual meal-sized portions in
              order to keep any leftovers from coming into contact with the air.
            </li>
            <li>
              Label them with the date of packaging so that you can later
              determine how fresh those peas are.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lastly, you can store it in the freezer and eat it over the
              following eight to twelve months.

          <ul className="space-y-1.5 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              After bringing 3 to 4 liters of water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon
              salt, 2 teaspoons sugar, and a pinch of baking soda (optional, but
              it will make the color brighter for longer).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the green peas and cook for just two minutes, or until the
              water is bubbling hot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Put this right away in some ice-cold water. &quot;We don&apos;t
              want to cook the green peas because that will avoid unsightly
              wrinkles on the skin&apos;s surface,&quot; said Shah.
            </li>
            <li>
              The process of drying is crucial. By doing this, you can be sure
              that your frozen green peas won&apos;t stick together when frozen.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Baking soda merely raises the pH of the water to a slightly alkaline
          level, which intensifies the green hue and increases stability. I
          heartily endorse it, Shah continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can increase the likelihood that peas will stay bright green for a
          full year in the freezer by following these instructions. For best
          results, use fresh, high-quality peas, according to clinical
          nutritionist Garima Goyal.

          <ul className="space-y-1.5 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Color retention: Blanching stops the enzymes that cause color
              fading in peas, allowing their vivid green color to be retained.
              According to Goyal, this keeps their visual appeal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Texture preservation: Blanching helps to preserve the crisp
              texture of peas by inhibiting the activity of enzymes that can
              break down cell walls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Retention of nutrients: Blanching may cause some nutrient loss,
              but it is negligible in comparison to other cooking techniques.
              Blanching preserves a large amount of the nutrients in the peas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enzyme inactivation: Blanching keeps the peas&apos; original
              flavor intact by inactivating enzymes that may alter their flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cleaning & surface impurity removal: Blanching improves the safety

        became dry from all the travelling. Mira posted on her Instagram
        Stories, &quot;Cold country, central heating, and overall dryness of the
        season has made my skin pretty dry…nothing works better than raw milk a
        couple of times over. Just add some rosewater to mask the smell.&quot;

        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">Is it effective?</span>
          <span>
            Raw milk is a powerful ally against dryness, according to Dr.
            Shraddha Deshpande, an aesthetic, plastic, and reconstructive
            surgeon at Wockhardt Hospitals Mumbai Central. &quot;Packed with
            vital nutrients like A, D, and E, raw milk functions as a skin
            hydration powerhouse, providing parched cells with elements that
            promote suppleness and resilience,&quot; stated Dr. Deshpande.
          </span>
          <span>
            Its natural fats create a barrier that keeps moisture in and keeps
            dryness from penetrating the skin. Dr. Deshpande stated, &quot;The
            addition of lactic acid, a mild exfoliant, not only refines the
            skin&apos;s texture but also enhances its ability to absorb and
            retain moisture.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            Agreed to suggest that raw milk is a mild yet potent moisturizer.
            Its high fat content—which includes omega-3 fatty acids—helps
            moisturize and nourish the skin, preventing flakiness and reducing
            dryness. According to Dr. Rinky Kapoor, dermato-surgeon, cosmetic
            dermatologist, and consultant dermatologist at The Esthetic Clinics,
            &quot;the lactic acid in raw milk acts as a mild exfoliant, removing
            dead skin cells and promoting a smoother complexion.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            Furthermore, vitamins A and D, which are well-known for their
            ability to renew and repair skin, are present in raw milk. Raw milk
            is an excellent remedy for fighting dryness because these vitamins
            contribute to enhanced elasticity and overall skin health, according
            to Dr. Kapoor.

            compounds found in hot chocolate. According to Amreen Shaikh, head
            dietitian at Wockhardt Hospitals in Mumbai Central, &quot;these
            elements can potentially elevate mood by stimulating the release of
            endorphins, fostering feelings of contentment and overall
            well-being.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            2. Benefits from antioxidants: Flavonoids, the main component of hot
            chocolate, are abundant in antioxidants found in cocoa. &quot;These
            powerful ingredients fight free radicals, which may reduce the risk
            of chronic illnesses and improve heart health,&quot; Amreen stated.
          </span>
          <span>
            3. Nutrient enrichment: Dark chocolate or premium cocoa powder used
            to make hot chocolate is a great way to get important minerals like
            potassium, magnesium, and iron. This makes a substantial
            contribution to the maintenance of body functions and total nutrient
            intake.
          </span>
          <span>
            4. Comforting warmth: This beverage&apos;s warmth provides relief
            and a feeling of coziness during the chilly winter months, which is
            beneficial for mental health and emotional balance.

        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">Possible Adverse Repercussions:</span>
          <span>
            1. High calorie and sugar content: Many hot chocolate mixes and
            prepared versions that are sold commercially are loaded with added
            sugar and calories. Frequent consumption of these kinds could hasten
            weight gain and increase vulnerability to diseases like diabetes,
            according to Amreen. Chocolate has been found to contain both
            mood-elevating and anti-inflammatory flavonoids in several studies.
            The cacao plant&apos;s pods, which are used to make cocoa, contain
            theobromine, a substance that lowers blood pressure and reduces
            inflammation. According to dietician Rishika Meetu of Bhatia
            Hospital in Mumbai, &quot;choosing a healthy cup of hot chocolate
            during the winter would be better, but be sure to drink it in
            moderation as chocolate itself contains sugar and saturated
            fat.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            2. The composition of caffeine: Although hot chocolate normally has
            less caffeine than coffee, it still has some. Amreen says if someone
            is sensitive to caffeine, an excessive amount may cause jitters,
            increase heart rate, or interfere with sleep cycles.
          </span>
          <span>
            3. Digestive difficulties: Because of their richness and high fat
            content, some hot chocolate preparations can cause “digestive
            discomfort, particularly in individuals grappling with lactose
            intolerance or other sensitivities”.
          </span>
          <span>
            4. Additives and processing: Preservatives, artificial flavors, and
            additives are commonly found in packaged hot chocolate mixes.
            According to Amreen, consuming these ingredients on a regular basis
            could be detrimental to one&apos;s overall health.
          </span>
        </div>
        <br />
        When consumed in moderation, hot chocolate can be easily incorporated
        into a balanced diet without having a noticeable negative impact.
        &quot;You can counteract potential negative consequences by making
        homemade versions using high-quality cocoa powder, minimal sugar, and
        non-dairy milk substitutes,&quot; stated Amreen.

        The body naturally experiences flatulence when we are awake as well as
        when we are asleep. Farting while you sleep and experiencing gas in your
        digestive system are common, especially if you go to bed soon after
        dinner.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the large intestine, bacteria inherently produce gas during food
        digestion. While some gas is normal during pregnancy and menstruation,
        eating specific foods, swallowing air, and experiencing a number of
        digestive disorders can all lead to excessive gas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although gas is usually not a cause for concern, if it is accompanied by
        other symptoms like pain, vomiting, or unexplained weight loss, it could
        indicate a serious health problem. Although people can control when they
        flatulate during the day, gas passes involuntarily when the anal
        sphincter relaxes after sleep.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div className="flex flex-col">
          <span className="text-xl">What should you remember?</span>
          <span>
            Although everyone swallows some air, ingesting excessive amounts of
            air can cause gas. Farting is the release of trapped swallowed air
            that isn&apos;t released through burping.
          </span>
        </div>
        <br />
        <div className="space-y-1">
          <span className="text-xl">
            At some times, people swallow more air, as such:
          </span>
          <ul className="space-y-1 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>Consuming tobacco</li>
            <li>Eating while standing up or too quickly</li>
            <li>Utilizing a straw to drink</li>
            <li>Being twitchy or uneasy</li>
            <li>Wearing poorly fitting dentures</li>
            <li>Gum chewing</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br />
        While not all foods cause gas, some foods that are known to cause gas
        include dairy products, beans, fruits, whole grains breads and other
        baked goods, carbonated drinks like soda and seltzer, and artificial
        sweeteners. Some vegetables that are known to cause gas include
        asparagus, Brussel sprouts, broccoli, corn, and potatoes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Constipation, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), Crohn&apos;s disease,
        celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and
        gastroesophageal reflux disease are among the digestive disorders linked
        to flatulence.

        This year, a lot of celebrities and fitness enthusiasts participated in
        the mobility challenge, which took over social media. It is an excellent
        method of assessing the body&apos;s flexibility. Known for her toned
        body and excellent physical condition, Shilpa Shetty Kundra was one of
        the challengers.
        <br />
        <br />
        After accepting the mobility challenge, the actor shared it on social
        media. She also gave her followers an explanation of its advantages.
        Shilpa can be seen exercising in a gym in the video. She kneels on the
        ground and first brings her hands in a crisscross pattern to her
        shoulders. She then lowers herself to a squat and stands back up.
        <br />
        <br />
        The ability of joints to move pain-free and within their full range of
        motion is referred to as mobility. This comprises the muscles and
        connective tissue surrounding the joint, as well as their strength,
        flexibility, and control. Maintaining proper form during exercises,
        avoiding injuries, and enhancing general athletic performance all depend
        on having good mobility. Muscle imbalances and compensations brought on
        by poor mobility can hinder the achievement of fitness objectives and
        raise the risk of injury.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mobility issues can affect people of all ages and fitness levels, but
        certain groups may be more vulnerable than others. According to Agrawal,
        those who are older, sedentary, athletes, injured, or have a disability
        are more likely to experience mobility issues, as are those who have bad
        posture.

          <span className="text-xl">
            In the expert&apos;s opinion, you can improve your mobility in the
            following ways:
          </span>
          <ul className="space-y-1">
            <li>
              <span className="font-normal">*Maintain proper posture:</span>{" "}
              Improper posture can lead to limited mobility and stiff joints.
              Maintaining proper posture during the day can enhance range of
              motion and joint alignment.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-normal">*Mobility exercises:</span> Include
              targeted mobility drills in your exercise regimen. These can
              include exercises like hip openers and shoulder stretches that
              concentrate on particular joints or muscle groups.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-normal">*Strength training:</span> By
              offering stability and support, strengthening the muscles
              surrounding a joint can help increase mobility. It is possible to
              achieve effective resistance training with weights, resistance
              bands, or bodyweight exercises.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-normal">*Stretching:</span> To increase
              flexibility and joint range of motion, stretch on a regular basis
              as part of your exercise regimen. It can be beneficial to stretch
              both dynamically prior to exercise and statically following
              exercise. Pilates and yoga are also excellent methods for
              increasing mobility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-normal">*Foam rolling:</span> Using a foam
              roller to relieve muscle tension and enhance joint flexibility can
              be beneficial. Additionally, foam rolling can enhance muscle
              recovery and blood flow to the muscles.
            </li>
          </ul>
