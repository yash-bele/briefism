          Rakul Preet Singh enjoys eating well-balanced meals in addition to
          exercising to maintain her physical fitness. She therefore always goes
          for basic but balanced meals, such as homemade or &quot;ghar ka
          khaana&quot; dishes. The Chhatriwali actor recently posted a photo of
          her plate, which featured a protein-rich scrambled egg, green moong
          dal, jowar roti, and a leafy vegetable.

          Rakul stated in the Instagram story that &quot;balance is the
          key.&quot; A well-balanced diet is essential for preserving general
          health and wellness. It aids in providing vital energy, vitamins,
          minerals, and nutrients that the body needs to function at its best.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;A balanced diet primarily makes sure the body gets enough of the
          macronutrientsâ€”carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The main source of
          energy for both physical activity and bodily processes is
          carbohydrates. Proteins maintain muscle mass, aid in tissue repair,
          and promote growth. The production of hormones, nutrient absorption,
          and cell function all depend on healthy fats,&quot; according to
          Ruchika Jain, chief clinical nutritionist at Fortis Hospital in Vasant
          Kunj.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-rounded diet places a strong emphasis on eating a variety of
          fruits and vegetables, which offer a wealth of vitamins, minerals, and
          antioxidants that are essential for strengthening the immune system,
          fending off infections, and lowering the risk of chronic conditions
          like diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Fibre, which is abundant in fruits, vegetables, and whole
          grains, helps with weight management and lowers the risk of obesity by
          promoting fullness, preventing constipation, and facilitating
          digestion,&quot; according to Jain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintaining a healthy weight and general health requires a balance
          between caloric intake and expenditure. Overindulging in calories can
          result in weight gain and associated health problems, while
          underconsuming calories can cause deficiencies and malnutrition.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Jain, getting enough water is important for many body
          processes, such as metabolism and the removal of toxins.
        </p>
        <p>
          A well-balanced diet promotes mental health, claims Jain. Jain stated,
          &quot;Important nutrients like Omega-3 fatty acids, which are present
          in nuts and fish, have been linked to improved cognitive function and
          reduced risk of depression.&quot; Nuts, flax seeds, chia seeds,
          salmon, and other well-known sources are among the others that you
          should include in your diet.
