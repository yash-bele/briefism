          Spider silk possesses incredible properties that make it highly
          desirable for various applications. It has immense strength,
          elasticity, and flexibility exceeding steel and Kevlar. Orb weaver
          spiders can spin massive strong webs up to 1.5 meters wide that can
          trap birds. If harnessed at scale, spider silk could transform fields
          like medicine, defense, textiles and aerospace.
        </p>

          However, spiders are nearly impossible to farm at a large scale due to
          their volatile nature. They frequently attack and eat each other when
          kept together, as per spider silk expert Aarathi Prasad. This
          limitation has stymied utilizing spider silk through history despite
          its virtues. But now scientists aim to produce it without relying on
          spiders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, researchers in China modified silkworms&apos; DNA using
          CRISPR gene editing to generate spider silk. The resulting silk had
          strength and elasticity approximating natural spider silk. This was a
          marked improvement over past approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, scientists at Utah State University earlier tried
          extracting spider silk protein from the milk of genetically engineered
          goats. But the silk fibers were weak. The goats now live on a
          university farm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previous artificial spider silk made in labs also lacked the
          protective glycoprotein coating spiders apply on their webs. Silkworms
          have an innate gland for secreting such coating, giving them an
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Prasad notes even silkworm spider silk can&apos;t perfectly
          replicate natural spider silk. In spiders, silk starts liquid before
          solidifying into threads. We don&apos;t fully understand this natural
          protein folding process that imparts strength. So silkworm silk will
          always be part spider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donghua University is working to get closer by tweaking the silkworm
          silk&apos;s molecular structure for more strength and elasticity. They
          highlight an existing robust silk supply chain for silkworms that
          allows scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to produce spider silk without spiders has exciting
          potential if the properties can be fine-tuned. The materials could
          replace plastics in some single-use products, given spider silk is
          biodegradable. Spider silk is also hypoallergenic, meaning medical
          devices and sutures made from it would not cause reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spider silk could have applications in bulletproof vests, parachute
          cords, artificial tendons, and even space suits owing to its
          durability and lightness. It could reinforce airplane panels and
          suspensions bridges. The biocompatibility opens up possibilities in
          tissue engineering as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, scaling up artificial spider silk does raise ecological
          concerns. Introducing genetically engineered silkworms or goats in the
          wild could impact natural populations and ecosystems. Tight regulation
          around their use in closed facilities would be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also ethical dilemmas regarding animal gene editing that
          require careful consideration. While spider silk production has
          benefits, it should not come at the cost of animal welfare or
          conservation. Striking the right balance will be key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The field does show how biotechnology can provide solutions where
          nature poses challenges. But replicating the complex marvel of
          evolution requires nuance. Artificial spider silk may find uses where
          natural silk isn&apos;t viable, but it seems unlikely to completely
          replace real spider silk. There are limits to bioengineering the
          intricate biological processes still being unravelled.
