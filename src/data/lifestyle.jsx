          Winter is the season to gather colorful, flavorful, and in-season
          fruits and vegetables. Green peas are a winter vegetable that people
          all over the world love. These green pods are a fantastic source of
          different vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber in addition to being
          loaded with antioxidants. Whether consumed raw during harvest or
          frozen, green peas have earned a reputation as a popular and adaptable
          component in cuisines all over the world.

          Let&apos;s investigate ways to keep green peas fresher at home so we
          can eat them practically all year round!

            Ananya Chowdhury, a software engineer, gardener, and enthusiast from
            Pune, shared the following tips:
          </span>
          <ul className="space-y-1 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Start by removing the peas from their pods and throwing away any
              that are damaged or discolored.
            </li>
            <li>
              The blanching process comes next. Using a strainer or a blanching
              basket, blanch those peas in boiling water for one to two minutes.
              Subsequently, quickly place them in an ice bath. This procedure
              preserves its maximum nutritional value in addition to preserving
              its vivid green color. According to Chowdhury, blanching is
              crucial for inactivating enzymes and lowering the microbial load
              on the peas, which minimizes the chance of bacterial or microbial
              growth during storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              After they&apos;ve cooled, pat them dry with a fresh paper towel
              or kitchen towel.
            </li>
            <li>
              These peas can now be kept in freezer-safe containers, heavy-duty
              freezer bags, or airtight zip-lock bags. Before packaging, it is
              advised to portion the peas into individual meal-sized portions in
              order to keep any leftovers from coming into contact with the air.
            </li>
            <li>
              Label them with the date of packaging so that you can later
              determine how fresh those peas are.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lastly, you can store it in the freezer and eat it over the
              following eight to twelve months.

            In a comprehensive guide, Chef Neha Deepak Shah shares her insights
            on:
          </span>
          <ul className="space-y-1 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              After bringing 3 to 4 liters of water to a boil, add 1 tablespoon
              salt, 2 teaspoons sugar, and a pinch of baking soda (optional, but
              it will make the color brighter for longer).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the green peas and cook for just two minutes, or until the
              water is bubbling hot.
            </li>
            <li>
              Put this right away in some ice-cold water. &quot;We don&apos;t
              want to cook the green peas because that will avoid unsightly
              wrinkles on the skin&apos;s surface,&quot; said Shah.
            </li>
            <li>
              The process of drying is crucial. By doing this, you can be sure
              that your frozen green peas won&apos;t stick together when frozen.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Baking soda merely raises the pH of the water to a slightly alkaline
          level, which intensifies the green hue and increases stability. I
          heartily endorse it, Shah continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can increase the likelihood that peas will stay bright green for a
          full year in the freezer by following these instructions. For best
          results, use fresh, high-quality peas, according to clinical
          nutritionist Garima Goyal.

            Blanching peas has a number of advantages:
          </span>
          <ul className="space-y-1 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Color retention: Blanching stops the enzymes that cause color
              fading in peas, allowing their vivid green color to be retained.
              According to Goyal, this keeps their visual appeal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Texture preservation: Blanching helps to preserve the crisp
              texture of peas by inhibiting the activity of enzymes that can
              break down cell walls.
            </li>
            <li>
              Retention of nutrients: Blanching may cause some nutrient loss,
              but it is negligible in comparison to other cooking techniques.
              Blanching preserves a large amount of the nutrients in the peas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enzyme inactivation: Blanching keeps the peas&apos; original
              flavor intact by inactivating enzymes that may alter their flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cleaning & surface impurity removal: Blanching improves the safety
              of peas by cleaning them and getting rid of any bacteria or
              surface impurities.

        When it comes to do-it-yourself beauty treatments, home remedies are the
        best. It comes as no surprise, then, that Mira Kapoor uses a lot of
        these remedies in her skincare regimen. After returning from her
        Bhutanese New Year&apos;s vacation, Mira talked about how her skin
        became dry from all the travelling. Mira posted on her Instagram
        Stories, &quot;Cold country, central heating, and overall dryness of the
        season has made my skin pretty dry…nothing works better than raw milk a
        couple of times over. Just add some rosewater to mask the smell.&quot;
        <br />
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">Is it effective?</span>
          <span>
            Raw milk is a powerful ally against dryness, according to Dr.
            Shraddha Deshpande, an aesthetic, plastic, and reconstructive
            surgeon at Wockhardt Hospitals Mumbai Central. &quot;Packed with
            vital nutrients like A, D, and E, raw milk functions as a skin
            hydration powerhouse, providing parched cells with elements that
            promote suppleness and resilience,&quot; stated Dr. Deshpande.
          </span>
          <span>
            Its natural fats create a barrier that keeps moisture in and keeps
            dryness from penetrating the skin. Dr. Deshpande stated, &quot;The
            addition of lactic acid, a mild exfoliant, not only refines the
            skin&apos;s texture but also enhances its ability to absorb and
            retain moisture.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            Agreed to suggest that raw milk is a mild yet potent moisturizer.
            Its high fat content—which includes omega-3 fatty acids—helps
            moisturize and nourish the skin, preventing flakiness and reducing
            dryness. According to Dr. Rinky Kapoor, dermato-surgeon, cosmetic
            dermatologist, and consultant dermatologist at The Esthetic Clinics,
            &quot;the lactic acid in raw milk acts as a mild exfoliant, removing
            dead skin cells and promoting a smoother complexion.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            Furthermore, vitamins A and D, which are well-known for their
            ability to renew and repair skin, are present in raw milk. Raw milk
            is an excellent remedy for fighting dryness because these vitamins
            contribute to enhanced elasticity and overall skin health, according
            to Dr. Kapoor.

        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">Way of application</span>
          <span>
            A light coat is all that is needed to incorporate raw milk into your
            skincare routine. &quot;The nourishing properties penetrate and
            revitalise the skin when a thin layer is diligently massaged onto
            cleansed skin,&quot; Dr. Deshpande stated.
