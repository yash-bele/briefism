        When it comes to do-it-yourself beauty treatments, home remedies are the
        best. It comes as no surprise, then, that Mira Kapoor uses a lot of
        these remedies in her skincare regimen. After returning from her
        Bhutanese New Year&apos;s vacation, Mira talked about how her skin
        became dry from all the travelling. Mira posted on her Instagram
        Stories, &quot;Cold country, central heating, and overall dryness of the
        season has made my skin pretty dry…nothing works better than raw milk a
        couple of times over. Just add some rosewater to mask the smell.&quot;

            Raw milk is a powerful ally against dryness, according to Dr.
            Shraddha Deshpande, an aesthetic, plastic, and reconstructive
            surgeon at Wockhardt Hospitals Mumbai Central. &quot;Packed with
            vital nutrients like A, D, and E, raw milk functions as a skin
            hydration powerhouse, providing parched cells with elements that
            promote suppleness and resilience,&quot; stated Dr. Deshpande.

            Its natural fats create a barrier that keeps moisture in and keeps
            dryness from penetrating the skin. Dr. Deshpande stated, &quot;The
            addition of lactic acid, a mild exfoliant, not only refines the
            skin&apos;s texture but also enhances its ability to absorb and
            retain moisture.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            Agreed to suggest that raw milk is a mild yet potent moisturizer.
            Its high fat content—which includes omega-3 fatty acids—helps
            moisturize and nourish the skin, preventing flakiness and reducing
            dryness. According to Dr. Rinky Kapoor, dermato-surgeon, cosmetic
            dermatologist, and consultant dermatologist at The Esthetic Clinics,
            &quot;the lactic acid in raw milk acts as a mild exfoliant, removing
            dead skin cells and promoting a smoother complexion.&quot;
          </span>
          <span>
            Furthermore, vitamins A and D, which are well-known for their
            ability to renew and repair skin, are present in raw milk. Raw milk
            is an excellent remedy for fighting dryness because these vitamins
            contribute to enhanced elasticity and overall skin health, according
            to Dr. Kapoor.

          <span>
            A light coat is all that is needed to incorporate raw milk into your
            skincare routine. &quot;The nourishing properties penetrate and
            revitalise the skin when a thin layer is diligently massaged onto
            cleansed skin,&quot; Dr. Deshpande stated.
