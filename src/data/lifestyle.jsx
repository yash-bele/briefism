            Ageing is characterized by a gradual loss of homeostasis, diminished
            function, cognitive decline, and an increased risk of dying from
            infectious, metabolic, neoplastic, and chronic illnesses. There's
            more to ageing gracefully than just looking younger. Our gut
            microbiota is a key player in this context.

            The microbiota of the gut and the process of aging
          </span>
          <span>
            Numerous aspects of human health depend on the gut microbiota, which
            is composed of a diverse range of microorganisms such as bacteria,
            viruses, and fungi. It has a major impact on our immune system in
            addition to aiding in digestion and nutritional absorption. Our gut
            microbiota's makeup can change with age and is constantly evolving.
            Numerous factors, including food habits, drug use, and lifestyle
            decisions, can have an impact on these changes. Disproportion of
            beneficial to harmful microorganisms can lead to dysbiosis, a
            condition caused by an imbalance in the gut microbiota. In reality,
            unhealthful aging contributes to the continued growth of infections
            including Fusobacteria, Streptococcus, Eggerthella, and others.

            As we grow older, it's important to manage body swelling, or
            "inflammaging." Our stomach bacteria, along with genes, plays a
            role. We can care for our stomach bacteria by changing our
            lifestyle, understanding it better, and making healthy food choices.
            This may lower the risk of age-related diseases and support a
            healthier old age.

            The Prime Minister launched the National Sickle Cell Anemia
            Elimination Mission on July 1, 2023, in Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh.
            This program is working intensely to find, prevent, and manage
            sickle cell anemia in areas with many tribal and high-risk
            populations across different states and union territories in India.
          </span>
          <span>
            India has 67.8 million tribal people, making up 8.6% of the
            population, according to the 2011 Census.
          </span>
          <span>
            The mission focuses on 278 districts in 17 states with higher rates
            of sickle cell disease. These states include Gujarat, Maharashtra,
            Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal,
            Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Assam,
            Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Bihar, and Uttarakhand.

          <span>
            Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood problem found more
            often in tribal communities in India, but it can affect non-tribal
            people too. It happens when someone inherits two unusual genes, one
            from each parent, causing the creation of abnormal hemoglobin called
            hemoglobin S (HbS). Sometimes, HbS makes red blood cells stiff and
            shaped like crescent moons, which can block blood flow and cause
            pain and tissue damage.
          </span>
          <span>
            SCD also leads to anemia and reduces the ability to carry oxygen in
            the body. Symptoms include ongoing pain, anemia, vulnerability to
            infections, and harm to organs. Although there's no cure, treatments
            like blood transfusions and medication can help manage symptoms. In
            some cases, bone marrow or stem cell transplants may be considered.
            Early detection, regular medical care, and a healthy lifestyle can
            significantly improve the life quality of those with sickle cell
            disease.

        To keep your eyes healthy, health experts suggest eating specific foods
        and doing healthy things to take care of your eyes and your overall
        well-being.
        <br />
        <br />
        Eat lots of fruits and vegetables for good eye health. Leafy greens like
        kale and spinach have vitamins that help your eyes, and fatty fish like
        salmon can prevent dry eyes. Fruits such as kiwis, oranges, and berries
        protect your eyes by reducing stress. Citrus fruits have vitamin C,
        which is good for your eye blood vessels. Eating a variety of colorful
        fruits and veggies is the best way to get all the nutrients your eyes
        need.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maintaining an optimal balance of micronutrients such as zinc and
        vitamin E is crucial. Almonds and sunflower seeds, among other nuts and
        seeds, are excellent sources of vitamin E and can help ward off
        age-related vision issues. In order to maintain the health of your body
        and eyes, don't forget to drink adequate water. Take breaks and observe
        the 20-20-20 rule, which states that you should look at something 20
        feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes, if you spend a lot of time
        staring at screens. This may lessen eye fatigue. In order to shield your
        eyes from the sun's damaging rays, which can result in conditions like
        cataracts, remember to wear sunglasses outside.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maintain good habits and eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods to keep
        your eyes healthy. Eating a varied diet rich in fruits, vegetables,
        berries, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes is good for your eyes in
        particular and your general health. Omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods like
        walnuts, flaxseeds, and fatty fish are beneficial for the structural
        integrity of your eyes. For optimal vision and general eye health,
        include foods high in vitamins A and C, such as eggs and dairy, and
        foods high in vitamins C and E, such as citrus fruits, bell peppers, and
        nuts. To prevent dry eyes, make sure you drink enough water. To lessen
        inflammation, limit your intake of processed foods and sugars.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wear sunglasses in the sun to protect your eyes from harmful rays. Use
        the 20-20-20 rule if you spend a lot of time on smart devices: every 20
        minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away. This
        lessens the strain on the eyes. Additionally, schedule routine eye exams
        to detect any issues early. To keep your blood pressure and blood sugar
        under control, heed your doctor's advice if you have high blood pressure
        or diabetes. Neglecting these preventative steps may have detrimental
        effects on your eyes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Eat well, stay hydrated, and engage in healthy activities to maintain
        the health of your eyes. Shield your eyes from environmental factors and
        stress. Seeking individualized guidance from an eye care specialist is a
        smart move.
