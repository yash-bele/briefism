          For the past few years, the best Android smartphone has been
          recognized as the Galaxy S series &quot;Ultra&quot; model. The South
          Korean giant&apos;s Ultra smartphone, which offered the best of both
          worlds after the Note lineup was discontinued, appears to be pushing
          the boundaries of hardware and software capabilities even further this
          year.

          The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is slated to launch on January 17 and is
          anticipated to be a benchmark in terms of features and specifications.
          Here&apos;s everything you need to know about Samsung&apos;s upcoming
          premium non-foldable flagship, which will be unveiled at Samsung
          Galaxy Unpacked 2024.

          <p>
            In 2023, we saw firsthand the transformative potential of generative
            artificial intelligence (AI). Now, with the Galaxy S24 Ultra,
            Samsung is probably going to expand on these applications by
            integrating AI into the smartphone. Samsung is probably going to
            provide a couple more scenarios for the generative AI technology on
            devices. According to the leaks, Samsung is anticipated to provide
            features like real-time voice translation, an AI-powered wallpaper
            generator for simple customization, improved Bixby (at last), and
            optimized smartphone performance.
          </p>

            Although some of these features are already present on devices like
            the Google Pixel 8, Samsung will democratize these features with the
            Galaxy S24 Ultra, making them more accessible to a wider audience.
            Thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, these operations will be
            carried out on-device, making them more private and secure than
            those of comparable cloud-based services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Samsung is implementing &quot;AI Zoom&quot; technology
            on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. With the S24 Ultra, the company appears to
            be combining the power of hardware, software, and AI to further
            elevate the zooming capability by cleverly reconstructing the
            subject using generative AI. The Ultra series of smartphones were
            already known for their zooming prowess. These are a few of the
            Samsung promotional videos that showcase the AI Zoom functionality
            of the upcoming Galaxy S24 Ultra.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galaxy S24 Ultra&apos;s camera specs appear to be the same as
            those of the Galaxy S23 Ultra. The Galaxy S24 Ultra is rumored to
            come with a 200 MP primary camera, a 12 MP ultra-wide angle lens, a
            5x 50 MP periscope zoom lens, a 3x optical zoom lens, and a 12 MP
            selfie camera. The upcoming Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartphone has a
            high-resolution 50 MP sensor with 5x optical zoom and 10x lossless
            hybrid zoom, while the S23 Ultra has a 10 MP periscope zoom lens
            with 10x optical zoom. This is the only difference between the two
            generations of Samsung Galaxy Ultra smartphones.

          <p>
            The Galaxy S24 Ultra is almost certainly powered by the Snapdragon 8
            Gen 3 SoC, one of the first Android smartphone processors with
            on-device generative AI capability, according to a post made by
            Qualcomm India on X (formerly Twitter). The Galaxy S24 Ultra is
            expected to change this, as although there are many phones on the
            market with the same chip, none of them fully take advantage of this
            new technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Samsung has a history of releasing new software features before
            Android; in fact, Google incorporates TouchWiz and Samsung OneUI
            design cues into the core of Android. Many such features are
            anticipated for this year. Yet another update, OneUI 6.1, which is
            based on Android 14, is anticipated to come pre-installed on the
            smartphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Galaxy S24 Ultra may keep its 5,000 mAh battery that supports
            45W fast charging in addition to adding new Qi2 wireless charging
            support. This could mark the first time that a Galaxy device has
            MagSafe-like functionality.

          <p>
            Despite having a similar appearance to its predecessors, the Samsung
            Galaxy S24 Ultra appears to have improved hardware and software,
            along with additional generative AI capabilities. Accordingly, the
            Galaxy S24 Ultra may very well be the priciest non-foldable
            smartphone that Samsung has ever released. As a result, we should
            anticipate that the price of the Samsung smartphone that isn&apos;t
            foldable will go above Rs 1,50,000.
