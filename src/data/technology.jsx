          As Republic Day approaches, both Amazon and Flipkart are presenting
          substantial discounts on various smartphones. If you&apos;re in the
          market for a new mid-range phone that excels in both camera

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Motorola has recently introduced the G34, a budget-friendly phone
              equipped with the Snapdragon 695, a mid-range chipset commonly
              found in phones like the OnePlus CE 3 Lite and Poco X5. Operating
              on near-stock Android 14 with a few customizations, the Motorola
              G34 boasts a slightly smaller 6.5-inch LCD screen with a high
              refresh rate. It features a decent 50MP primary camera supported
              by another 2MP sensor. Priced starting at Rs 10,999, the Motorola
              G34 is a cost-effective choice.

            <p>
              The Poco M6 stands out as another budget-friendly 5G phone
              excelling in various aspects. Powered by the Dimensity 6100+ chip,
              the phone offers a sizable 6.74-inch LCD screen and a 50MP camera
              delivering decent daytime photos. For those seeking a
              budget-friendly 5G device with value for money and running on
              MIUI, the Poco M6 is a strong recommendation. The base version
              with 4GB RAM and 128GB storage is priced at Rs 9,999, while the
              6GB RAM variant, recommended for Rs 10,999, provides enhanced
              performance.

              The OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite may not boast the fastest processor or
              the best camera, but it compensates with a smooth user experience.
              Running on OxygenOS 13.1, this mid-range 5G phone ensures two
              years of OS updates and features a 108MP camera delivering average
              photos. Although it lacks an AMOLED screen, for users prioritizing
              a clean and smooth user interface, the Nord CE 3 Lite, starting
              from Rs 19,999, proves to be a reliable choice.

          Realme founder and CEO Sky Li announced on social media that the
          company will soon launch the “Note” series of smartphones, positioned
          to compete with Xiaomi&apos;s popular Redmi Note lineup. Catering to
          demand for large-screen devices, the Realme Note series aims to
          provide affordable big-screen options for buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Realme currently offers the budget C series, mid-range numbered series
          and flagship GT series. The upcoming Note lineup is expected to slot
          between the regular number series and premium GT series.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to leaks, the first device Realme Note 1 will sport a
          6.67-inch 120Hz OLED display with FHD+ resolution and in-screen
          fingerprint scanner. It is tipped to be powered by the MediaTek
          Dimensity 7050 chipset. The triple camera setup may include a 108MP
          main camera, 8MP ultrawide lens and 2MP macro camera, plus a 16MP
          selfie camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Note 1 is said to pack a 5,000mAh battery with 67W fast charging
          support and stereo speakers. Going by the leaked specs versus Infinix
          Note 30 and Redmi Note 13, the Realme Note 1 could be priced
          attractively under Rs 20,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unclear when the Note 1 will launch and if the lineup will offer
          Pro/Pro+ models like Redmi Note series. Meanwhile, Realme just
          confirmed its 12 Pro series launch in India on January 29th.

        <p>
          With the Note series, Realme aims to capture the market for affordable
          big-screen smartphones, which is currently dominated by Xiaomi&apos;s
          Redmi Note. Realme&apos;s numbered series and GT series don&apos;t
          offer many low-cost large display options currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaked 6.67-inch screen size reveals Realme plans to compete
          head-on with Redmi Note in the budget big-screen segment. The OLED
          panel and 120Hz refresh rate also give it an edge over LCD displays of
          competing devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powered by a capable Dimensity 7050 chipset, the Note series will
          offer higher performance than Redmi&apos;s Snapdragon 4 Gen 1-based
          Note 13. The flagship-grade 108MP camera will also provide superior
          photography experience and lend premium appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced attractively under Rs 20,000, the Note series solves
          Realme&apos;s gap in affordable large-screen smartphones. It neatly
          slots between the premium GT and regular number series. With a
          value-for-money formula of good specs, big display and low price, it
          can shake up the budget smartphone landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Realme will need to ensure compelling differentiators beyond
          just large screens to stand out against Redmi&apos;s strong brand
          presence and familiar Note series. Smooth software, good battery life
          and appealing design will be key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the Note lineup indicates Realme&apos;s strategy of covering
          all price tiers and consumer needs. Alongside its budget C series,
          performance-centric GT models and all-rounder number series, the Note
          range helps Realme cement its &quot;value flagship&quot; appeal and
          take on rival Xiaomi more strongly across segments.
