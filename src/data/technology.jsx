        <p>
          Beyond the single-player mode, Palworld has a multiplayer mode
          requiring teamwork to take on tough Pals and craft items to survive
          the harsh world. Gameplay involves base building like Minecraft, with
          the ability to loot other players&apos; bases and items.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can utilize enslaved Pals to construct bases, assign them tasks,
          force them to work, engage in farming, build houses and more. Each Pal
          has a distinct personality and food needs, suitable for different
          roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within just 8 hours of its early access launch on the popular Steam
          marketplace, Palworld sold over 1 million copies. Recently, some
          connectivity issues arose but developers quickly resolved them.
          Palworld has now surpassed Counter-Strike 2 as the game with the most
          concurrent players on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the controversial new game Palworld, which allows
          capturing and exploiting Pokemon-like creatures, has seen immense
          immediate success, selling 3 million copies and becoming a top-played
          title globally shortly after launching. Its unique mix of
          Pokemon-style collection and open-world survival gameplay has
          resonated widely despite ethical concerns.

        </p>
        <p>
          Peregrine&apos;s trajectory was set long before the loss of signal on
          Friday. It had launched on January 8th aboard the maiden flight of
          United Launch Alliance&apos;s Centaur rocket. The new Centaur rocket,
          a Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint venture, performed well. But
          shortly after Peregrine separated from the launch vehicle, it sprung a
          leak and spewed fuel.

        <p>
          The Astrobiotic mission was intended to be the first American soft
          landing on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. After detecting the fuel
          leak, Astrobiotic pivoted the mission to operate more like a
          satellite. They tested Peregrine&apos;s scientific instruments and
          systems as it flew thousands of kilometers before directing it to burn
          up in Earth&apos;s atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          If successful, it would have been the first private soft lunar
          landing, following the Israeli Beresheet mission in 2019 and Japanese
          UTO mission in 2023 which did achieve crash landings on the surface.
          Unfortunately, Peregrine did not progress as far.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the same day as Peregrine&apos;s loss of signal, the Japan
          Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) confirmed its Smart Lander for
          Investigating Moon (SLIM) successfully touched down, making Japan the
          fifth nation to accomplice a soft lunar landing after the U.S., Soviet
          Union, China and India.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the mission dubbed the “moon sniper” for its precision 100 meter
          landing capability has run into problems. The spacecraft&apos;s solar
          cells are not generating any power.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAXA attempted some life-sustaining measures like switching off
          SLIM&apos;s heater, but the battery can only endure for a few hours on
          the moon&apos;s surface. JAXA hopes a change in sunlight angle will
          energize the solar panels again.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been several moon missions in the last two years - Japan’s
          SLIM and Hakuto, Russia’s Luna-25, India&apos;s Chandrayaan-3,
          Peregrine and more, with varying outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This emphasizes the new space race and push to establish a sustained
          lunar presence. Once we have a moon base, it can propel missions
          deeper into space. While that future is distant, space technology has
          already benefited daily life with smartphone cameras, memory foam
          mattresses and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, advancements may enable connecting directly to satellite networks
          using just smartphones, without specialized hardware like satellite
          terminals or phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google, AT&T and Vodafone have invested over $155 million in AST
          SpaceMobile to develop direct-to-device satellite connectivity. In
          2023, the company demonstrated 2G, 4G and 5G calls and 14 Mbps
          downloads directly from a satellite to regular smartphones using those
          companies&apos; networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google will collaborate on product development, testing and
          implementation to enable SpaceMobile connectivity for Android devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while the two recent moon missions had different fates, the
          constant push to explore space will continue advancing technology that
          improves life on Earth too. Focus on the cosmos beyond will lead to
          innovations that enrich our world.

          WhatsApp has rolled out several new capabilities for its Channels
          feature to improve engagement between brands, celebrities, public
          figures and their audiences on the platform. Introduced in late 2022,
          Channels enables direct communication from these users to their
          followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted four key additions to WhatsApp
          Channels - voice messages, polls, multiple admins and content sharing
          to Status. These updates, now out of testing, will be available to all
          users soon on an unspecified date.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major change allows Channel admins to send voice messages. This
          provides a quick, personal way to share behind-the-scenes insights,
          make announcements and directly interact with followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of polls gives admins a handy tool to gather opinions and
          feedback from their audience on various topics, driving greater
          participation. Support for multiple Channel admins will be invaluable
          for large brands or organizations needing active management and prompt
          responses to incoming messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, followers can now share interesting Channel updates to their
          own WhatsApp Status. This viral feature expands the potential reach of
          content beyond the Channel&apos;s existing followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, these enhancements signal WhatsApp&apos;s efforts to make
          Channels a more engaging, interactive destination for both admins and
          their communities. With voice, polls, co-administration and built-in
          sharing, WhatsApp has meaningfully expanded Channels&apos;
          capabilities since launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          For public figures, brands and businesses, these features optimize
          Channels as a controlled space to foster direct conversations with
          followers at scale. Voice messages bring an authentic, personal touch
          while polls provide data-driven insights into audience preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to have multiple authenticated admins prevents bottlenecks
          in engaging active communities, while viral sharing of content helps
          expand visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          For followers, the updates make Channels a richer source of exclusive
          insights directly from the source. The additions encourage
          participating rather than just observing passive content.
        </p>
        <p>
          As WhatsApp continues developing Channels into a robust platform,
          these user-empowering features will significantly boost the appeal and
          utility for both creators and their communities seeking closer
          connections on WhatsApp.

          Apple has kicked off preorders for its hotly anticipated Vision Pro
          mixed reality headset, with early signs of robust customer demand
          quickly exhausting initial stock of the $3,499 device, as per a
          Bloomberg report.
        </p>
        <p>
          The headset became available for preorder online and on Apple&apos;s
          app at 8am Eastern time on Tuesday. Delivery dates have already been
          pushed back to March 8-15 for orders placed today, indicating either
          limited supplies, strong early interest, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rapid sellouts of in-store pickup appointments on day one at many
          locations also suggest high demand and/or constrained inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expanding options for consumers, Apple unveiled two additional
          configurations beyond the base 256GB model. A 512GB version costs
          $3,699, while a high-end 1TB option is priced at $3,899.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple is also selling a $199 case, $199 extra batteries, and $99
          replacement bands for the headset. However, the unique ordering
          process requires an iPhone or iPad to scan the customer&apos;s face
          for optimal fit and vision prescription if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple has not commented on sales, which is typical for new product
          launches. But Wall Street analysts forecast a measured start for the
          Vision Pro.
        </p>
        <p>
          UBS predicts Apple will ship 300,000-400,000 units this year,
          generating around $1.4 billion revenue. Despite the lofty $3,499 entry
          price, Apple seems to have modest expectations for a gradual launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially only available in the U.S., the headset will expand to other
          markets including the U.K., Canada and China. Per reports, Apple
          internally expects a strong opening weekend followed by declining
          sales in subsequent weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced much higher than Meta&apos;s latest offering, the Vision Pro is
          positioned as a premium device befitting its cutting-edge nature.
          However, the specialized sizing process poses challenges for sharing
          the headset with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unique face scan determines the ideal light seal and strap from 25
          seal options and 2 straps for each individual user. Prescription
          inserts cost extra too. Some testers have also cited the
          headset&apos;s weight as uncomfortable for long-term wear.
        </p>
        <p>
          While niche currently, the mixed reality market offers opportunities
          for Apple to woo its loyal, wealthy customer base with this futuristic
          product. The company&apos;s history of sleek design and intuitive
          interfaces helps cement the Vision Pro as the luxe choice for early
          adopters.

        </p>
        <p>
          In a separate development, Altman expressed his views on the rapid
          evolution of artificial intelligence during an interview with Axios at
          Davos. He emphasized that AI products must evolve to allow extensive
          individual customization, even if it means causing discomfort to
          certain individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Altman articulated, &quot;If the country said, you know, all gay
          people should be killed on sight, then no ...that is well out of
          bounds. But there are probably other things that I don&apos;t
          personally agree with, but a different culture might. …We have to be
          somewhat uncomfortable as a tool builder with some of the uses of our
          tools,&quot; addressing the ethical considerations surrounding AI
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creator of ChatGPT also offered insights into the future
          capabilities of AI. Altman suggested that, in the near future, users
          might have the ability to query AI about the most significant emails
          received throughout the day, enabling AI to provide concise summaries.
          This potential integration of AI into daily tasks offers a glimpse
          into the evolving landscape of AI applications, showcasing its
          increasing role in enhancing efficiency and convenience for users.

            Exploring Sam Altman&apos;s New Chip Venture:

              Sam Altman, who experienced a brief removal from OpenAI in
              November, swiftly reinstated, is endeavoring to secure substantial
              funding for the establishment of chip fabrication plants, commonly
              known as ‘fabs.’
            </li>
            <li>
              The production of chips incurs significant expenses, not only in
              terms of funding but also due to the substantial amounts of
              natural resources involved.
            </li>
            <li>
              According to Bloomberg&apos;s report, Altman&apos;s innovative
              project envisions collaboration with leading chip manufacturers,
              intending to create a global network of chip factories.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notable entities such as Intel, Taiwanese chipmaker Taiwan
              Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and Samsung Electronics have been
              identified as potential partners for OpenAI in this pioneering
              venture.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the current status of discussions with G42 and SoftBank
              Group remains unclear, the report suggests that G42, Altman&apos;s
              partner since October of the previous year, is concentrating on
              securing a substantial financial backing ranging between eight to
              ten billion dollars for the chip venture.

          The highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event is taking place
          today in San Jose, where the tech giant is expected to unveil its most
          advanced lineup of smartphones yet - the Galaxy S24 series. This new
          generation of Galaxy S devices promises major upgrades and
          improvements over their predecessors, making them Samsung&apos;s most
          powerful smartphones to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event is being held at the SAP Center in San Jose, California and
          starts at 1 PM EST for US audiences, while Indian viewers can tune in
          from 11:30 PM IST onwards. Samsung is live streaming the launch on
          their official YouTube channel and social media platforms like
          Facebook, ensuring global accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those interested in following the event through Samsung&apos;s
          official website have the chance to win a INR 5,000 voucher to spend
          on Samsung products. Additionally, by pre-paying INR 1,999, you can
          reserve a spot to be one of the first to purchase the new Galaxy S24
          smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumors suggest that the Galaxy S24+ may be priced between INR 1,04,999
          and INR 1,05,999 for the base 12GB RAM and 256GB storage model. This
          indicates a significant price jump of over INR 10,000 compared to last
          year&apos;s Galaxy S23+ which was priced at INR 94,999.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top-of-the-line Galaxy S24 Ultra is speculated to cost between INR
          1,34,999 and INR 1,35,999 for the same configuration. Again, this is
          approximately INR 10,000 more than the S23 Ultra&apos;s starting price
          of INR 1,24,999. Samsung appears to be considering a price hike for
          its flagship S series, although leaked information implies the company
          may retain existing prices. We will have to wait for official
          confirmation during the launch event.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no available information yet regarding the pricing of the
          standard Galaxy S24. For reference, the S23 was launched at INR 74,999
          last year. Samsung may continue the same starting price for the base
          S24 model, limiting the price increases to the S24+ and S24 Ultra
          only. This mirrors Apple&apos;s strategy with its recent iPhone 15
          lineup.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S24 series have already
          commenced on Samsung&apos;s official website. With powerful upgrades,
          new AI capabilities, and potentially higher prices, Samsung aims to
          position the S24 series as its most premium smartphone range ever.
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-1.5">
          <span className="text-xl">Key highlights expected include:</span>
          <ul className="space-y-1.5 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Enhanced camera systems with new 200MP sensor on Ultra model
            </li>
            <li>Latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor for maximum performance</li>
            <li>Brighter, more dynamic displays with higher refresh rates</li>

            <li>OneUI 5.1 based on Android 13</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          With online reservations already open, stay tuned to Samsung
          India&apos;s social channels and the Galaxy Unpacked livestream to
          catch all the official Galaxy S24 details as they are announced. This

            <p>
              This Android feature enables searching anything on-screen without

              button then highlight an object with tap, circle, scribble, etc.

              For example, if an influencer shows untagged fashion items, circle
              them to instantly find and shop similar styles from various
              retailers. Once done, swipe back to the original app.
            </p>
            <p>
              As per Google, AI upgrades like multisearch (text and image
              queries) already help users grasp concepts and topics by
              aggregating helpful web information. Circle to Search brings that
              convenience directly into any app. It launches first on select
              premium Android devices like the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Galaxy
              S24 series.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;Circle to Search significantly advances expressing needs
              conveniently without changing contexts. Combined with multisearch,
              it enables more intuitive, natural search,&quot; said Alistair

              Users can now point their camera at anything, snap a picture, or
              upload a screenshot to ask a visual question. This utilizes
              generative AI to instantly provide overview insights.

              Google states this allows more nuanced visual queries to swiftly
