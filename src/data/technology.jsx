          WhatsApp has rolled out several new capabilities for its Channels
          feature to improve engagement between brands, celebrities, public
          figures and their audiences on the platform. Introduced in late 2022,
          Channels enables direct communication from these users to their
          followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted four key additions to WhatsApp
          Channels - voice messages, polls, multiple admins and content sharing
          to Status. These updates, now out of testing, will be available to all
          users soon on an unspecified date.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major change allows Channel admins to send voice messages. This
          provides a quick, personal way to share behind-the-scenes insights,
          make announcements and directly interact with followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of polls gives admins a handy tool to gather opinions and
          feedback from their audience on various topics, driving greater
          participation. Support for multiple Channel admins will be invaluable
          for large brands or organizations needing active management and prompt
          responses to incoming messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, followers can now share interesting Channel updates to their
          own WhatsApp Status. This viral feature expands the potential reach of
          content beyond the Channel&apos;s existing followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, these enhancements signal WhatsApp&apos;s efforts to make
          Channels a more engaging, interactive destination for both admins and
          their communities. With voice, polls, co-administration and built-in
          sharing, WhatsApp has meaningfully expanded Channels&apos;
          capabilities since launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          For public figures, brands and businesses, these features optimize
          Channels as a controlled space to foster direct conversations with
          followers at scale. Voice messages bring an authentic, personal touch
          while polls provide data-driven insights into audience preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to have multiple authenticated admins prevents bottlenecks
          in engaging active communities, while viral sharing of content helps
          expand visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          For followers, the updates make Channels a richer source of exclusive
          insights directly from the source. The additions encourage
          participating rather than just observing passive content.
        </p>
        <p>
          As WhatsApp continues developing Channels into a robust platform,
          these user-empowering features will significantly boost the appeal and
          utility for both creators and their communities seeking closer
          connections on WhatsApp.

          Apple has kicked off preorders for its hotly anticipated Vision Pro
          mixed reality headset, with early signs of robust customer demand
          quickly exhausting initial stock of the $3,499 device, as per a
          Bloomberg report.
        </p>
        <p>
          The headset became available for preorder online and on Apple&apos;s
          app at 8am Eastern time on Tuesday. Delivery dates have already been
          pushed back to March 8-15 for orders placed today, indicating either
          limited supplies, strong early interest, or both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rapid sellouts of in-store pickup appointments on day one at many
          locations also suggest high demand and/or constrained inventory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expanding options for consumers, Apple unveiled two additional
          configurations beyond the base 256GB model. A 512GB version costs
          $3,699, while a high-end 1TB option is priced at $3,899.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple is also selling a $199 case, $199 extra batteries, and $99
          replacement bands for the headset. However, the unique ordering
          process requires an iPhone or iPad to scan the customer&apos;s face
          for optimal fit and vision prescription if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple has not commented on sales, which is typical for new product
          launches. But Wall Street analysts forecast a measured start for the
          Vision Pro.
        </p>
        <p>
          UBS predicts Apple will ship 300,000-400,000 units this year,
          generating around $1.4 billion revenue. Despite the lofty $3,499 entry
          price, Apple seems to have modest expectations for a gradual launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially only available in the U.S., the headset will expand to other
          markets including the U.K., Canada and China. Per reports, Apple
          internally expects a strong opening weekend followed by declining
          sales in subsequent weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced much higher than Meta&apos;s latest offering, the Vision Pro is
          positioned as a premium device befitting its cutting-edge nature.
          However, the specialized sizing process poses challenges for sharing
          the headset with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unique face scan determines the ideal light seal and strap from 25
          seal options and 2 straps for each individual user. Prescription
          inserts cost extra too. Some testers have also cited the
          headset&apos;s weight as uncomfortable for long-term wear.
        </p>
        <p>
          While niche currently, the mixed reality market offers opportunities
          for Apple to woo its loyal, wealthy customer base with this futuristic
          product. The company&apos;s history of sleek design and intuitive
          interfaces helps cement the Vision Pro as the luxe choice for early
          adopters.

          OpenAI&apos;s CEO, Sam Altman, is actively pursuing the mobilization

          Intelligence (AI) chip factories dedicated to semiconductor

          comprehensive list of potential partners and contributors to the
          venture is yet to be finalized.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a separate development, Altman expressed his views on the rapid
          evolution of artificial intelligence during an interview with Axios at
          Davos. He emphasized that AI products must evolve to allow extensive
          individual customization, even if it means causing discomfort to
          certain individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Altman articulated, &quot;If the country said, you know, all gay
          people should be killed on sight, then no ...that is well out of
          bounds. But there are probably other things that I don&apos;t
          personally agree with, but a different culture might. â€¦We have to be
          somewhat uncomfortable as a tool builder with some of the uses of our
          tools,&quot; addressing the ethical considerations surrounding AI
          applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creator of ChatGPT also offered insights into the future
          capabilities of AI. Altman suggested that, in the near future, users
          might have the ability to query AI about the most significant emails
          received throughout the day, enabling AI to provide concise summaries.
          This potential integration of AI into daily tasks offers a glimpse
          into the evolving landscape of AI applications, showcasing its
          increasing role in enhancing efficiency and convenience for users.

              Sam Altman, who experienced a brief removal from OpenAI in
              November, swiftly reinstated, is endeavoring to secure substantial
              funding for the establishment of chip fabrication plants, commonly
              known as â€˜fabs.â€™
            </li>
            <li>
              The production of chips incurs significant expenses, not only in
              terms of funding but also due to the substantial amounts of
              natural resources involved.
            </li>
            <li>
              According to Bloomberg&apos;s report, Altman&apos;s innovative
              project envisions collaboration with leading chip manufacturers,
              intending to create a global network of chip factories.
            </li>
            <li>
              Notable entities such as Intel, Taiwanese chipmaker Taiwan
              Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, and Samsung Electronics have been
              identified as potential partners for OpenAI in this pioneering
              venture.

            <li>
              While the current status of discussions with G42 and SoftBank
              Group remains unclear, the report suggests that G42, Altman&apos;s
              partner since October of the previous year, is concentrating on
              securing a substantial financial backing ranging between eight to
              ten billion dollars for the chip venture.
