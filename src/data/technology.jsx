          Samsung is actively pursuing the development of cutting-edge health
          sensors to rival Apple, as reported by Bloomberg&apos;s Mark Gurman.
          The company&apos;s goal is to incorporate noninvasive blood glucose
          monitoring and continuous blood pressure tracking across its product
          range.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative is part of Samsung&apos;s broader strategy to
          integrate advanced health features, exemplified by the recently
          unveiled Galaxy Ring smart ring. Hon Pak, a Samsung executive leading
          the health technology initiative, envisions providing consumers with a
          comprehensive overview of their well-being through sensors deployed on
          various body parts and within the home environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          During an interview, Pak emphasized the significance of achieving
          continuous blood pressure and glucose monitoring, recognizing it as a
          pivotal advancement. He stated, &quot;If we can do continuous blood
          pressure and glucose, we&apos;re in a whole different ballgame. I
          think that&apos;s where everyone is trying to get to. We&apos;re
          putting significant investment toward that.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s crucial to note that Apple has been actively working for
          years on developing a noninvasive glucose reader, a technology that
          holds immense potential benefits for diabetics. However, Pak refrains
          from providing a specific timeline for Samsung&apos;s
          technology&apos;s market debut, expressing optimism that some form of
          noninvasive glucose monitoring could become a reality within the next
          five years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galaxy Ring, recently introduced by Samsung and set for release by
          the end of 2024, will initially focus on tracking activity and sleep.
          Additional health features are planned for future updates. The
          discreet form factor of the ring may appeal to individuals seeking
          health tracking in a less conspicuous device compared to smartwatches.
          While pricing details are yet to be finalized, the Galaxy Ring is
          expected to lack iPhone compatibility, unlike Samsung&apos;s watches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gurman highlights the challenges associated with creating a
          noninvasive blood sugar monitor, noting Apple&apos;s struggles despite
          a decade of effort. Samsung is also working on enhancing blood
          pressure tracking on its smartwatches, aiming for reduced calibration
          requirements. Pak underscores the goal of providing blood pressure
          assessments that focus more on indicating cardiovascular risk rather
          than providing precise values.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to smart rings and watches, Samsung is exploring the
          integration of new sensors into earbuds. These sensors could track
          temperature and heart rate, leveraging the ear canal&apos;s proximity
          to the heart for more accurate measurements. The data from earbuds,
          combined with wrist-based measurements and environmental factors, aims
          to offer a more holistic health overview.

          Apple is releasing the iOS 17.3 update, introducing notable features
          such as &apos;Stolen Device Protection&apos; and &apos;Collaborative
          Apple Music Playlists.&apos; This update aims to enhance security
          measures and offer new avenues for interactive music experiences.
          Let&apos;s delve into the key highlights of iOS 17.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">Stolen Device Protection:</span>{" "}
          Addressing iPhone theft concerns, Apple introduces the &apos;Stolen
          Device Protection&apos; feature. This security enhancement imposes
          additional safeguards when the device is in locations outside of
          trusted environments like home or work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the device passcode, the feature incorporates biometric
          authentication requirements for tasks such as accessing iCloud-stored
          passwords, making Safari purchases, disabling Lost Mode, changing
          Apple ID credentials, altering the iPhone passcode, and initiating
          device data erasure. To activate this feature, users can navigate to
          the &apos;Face ID & Passcode&apos; section within device settings and
          enable the &apos;Stolen Device Protection&apos; toggle. This valuable
          security layer is applicable to all iPhones running iOS 17.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">
            Collaborative Apple Music Playlists:
          </span>{" "}
          iOS 17.3 introduces the much-awaited feature of collaborative
          playlists on Apple Music. This functionality, previously available in
          beta versions, empowers users to create playlists or leverage existing
          ones and invite friends or family to contribute songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To engage in this collaborative music experience, users can launch
          Apple Music, access a playlist, and tap on the person icon. This
          action generates a shareable link, enabling others to join and add
          songs to the playlist. Additionally, users listening to collaborative
          playlists can express reactions with emojis, such as hearts or thumbs
          up, which animate when the corresponding song is played.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">AirPlay Support for Hotels:</span> In
          a move to enhance user experiences in select hotels, iOS 17.3
          introduces AirPlay support. Users with updated devices can now
          seamlessly stream content from Apple devices like iPads, iPhones, and
          Macs in hotels deemed compatible with AirPlay by Apple. This
          functionality enables users to enjoy content from various streaming
          platforms on larger screens within the hotel environment, using their
          individual credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">AppleCare Coverage Display:</span>{" "}
          Another notable addition in iOS 17.3 is the display of AppleCare
          coverage for all devices associated with a user&apos;s Apple account.
          This information is conveniently accessible under the &apos;AppleCare
          and Warranty&apos; section within the &apos;General&apos; tab in the
          Settings app. This feature provides users with a comprehensive
          overview of AppleCare coverage for all their signed-in devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the iOS 17.3 update signifies Apple&apos;s commitment
          to enhancing user security, collaboration in music experiences, and
          seamless content streaming in select hotel environments. With these
          new features, Apple continues to refine and enrich the user experience
          across its range of devices.

          For those seeking a compact phone with flagship features at a more
          affordable price, the choice between the Apple iPhone 15 and the
          Samsung Galaxy S24 can be challenging. In this comparison, we&apos;ll
          explore key aspects to assist you in making an informed decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both the base models of the Galaxy S24 series and the iPhone 15 series
          feature flat displays with aluminum frames, maintaining consistency
          with their predecessors. However, design distinctions emerge, with the
          Galaxy S24 sporting a punch-hole display and the iPhone 15 adopting
          the Dynamic Island from the iPhone 14 Pro series. Back designs also
          differ, with Samsung opting for individual cutouts for each camera
          lens, while Apple employs a sizable camera island in the top left
          corner. Despite these differences, both phones exhibit similarities to
          their predecessors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galaxy S24, slightly lighter than the iPhone 15 by 4 grams, boasts
          a marginally larger 6.2-inch screen compared to the iPhone&apos;s 6.1
          inches. Both displays exhibit brightness under direct sunlight, but
          the Galaxy S24 gains an edge in scrolling responsiveness with its high
          refresh rate 120Hz display, surpassing the iPhone 15&apos;s 60Hz
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing between the two depends on user experience preferences. If
          you are already entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, the iPhone 15 may
          better suit your needs. Software-wise, the devices run on different
          operating systems, reflecting a matter of personal preference.
          Notably, the Galaxy S24&apos;s AI-powered features and a seven-year
          update policy, compared to the iPhone&apos;s five-year policy, offer
          potential advantages for Samsung users. Additionally, the Galaxy S24
          features an always-on display, leveraging its LTPO screen to conserve
          battery when enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of functionality, while the iPhone 15 maintains familiarity
          with previous models, the Galaxy S24 introduces AI-powered
          capabilities such as live call translation, &apos;Chat Assist,&apos;
          and &apos;Circle to Search&apos; through Galaxy AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance-wise, the Galaxy S24, equipped with the Exynos 2400
          chipset (benchmarks pending), competes with the iPhone 15 featuring
          Apple&apos;s A16 Bionic chipset. Although real-world performance
          remains to be seen, both phones are expected to handle multitasking
          without noticeable lag.
        </p>
        <p>
          The camera setups vary, with the Galaxy S24 featuring a 50MP primary
          camera, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom.
          The iPhone 15 opts for a 48MP main camera, a 12MP ultrawide, but lacks
          a dedicated telephoto lens. The choice may hinge on personal
          preference for portrait shots or consideration for video recording
          capabilities, with the Galaxy S24 supporting 8K recording compared to
          the iPhone 15&apos;s 4K limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite a larger on-paper battery capacity in the Galaxy S24,
          Apple&apos;s software optimization may result in similar screen-on
          times. Both phones offer comparable charging speeds, claiming a 50%
          charge in 30 minutes. Wireless charging and reverse wireless charging
          at 15W and 4.5W, respectively, provide additional flexibility for both
          devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pricing-wise, the Galaxy S24 and iPhone 15 fall within the same
          bracket, with the former priced at Rs 79,999 and the latter starting
          from Rs 79,990. Choosing between them depends on individual needs and
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the enduring Android vs. iOS debate, the Galaxy S24 stands out for
          those desiring generative AI features and frequent software updates.
          On the other hand, the iPhone 15 presents an excellent choice for
          Apple enthusiasts seeking value for money. Ultimately, the decision
          hinges on whether advanced AI capabilities or brand loyalty guides
          your smartphone preferences.

        <p>
          Riot Games, renowned for creating League of Legends and Valorant,
          declared on Monday its decision to terminate approximately 530 jobs,
          constituting 11% of its workforce. This strategic move aligns with a
          broader trend in the gaming industry and tech sector, where major
          companies are downsizing specific divisions to address escalating
          costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a blog post, Riot Games CEO Dylan Jadeja explained the rationale
          behind the layoffs. He emphasized that the company&apos;s rapid
          expansion in recent years, more than doubling its headcount, led to
          efforts being spread thin across numerous projects. The lack of clear
          prioritization prompted the need for adjustments to refocus on
          initiatives with the greatest impact on player experience while
          cutting investments in less crucial areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The impact of the layoffs will be most significant in teams outside of
          core development. Riot Games remains committed to prioritizing its
          core live games, including League of Legends, Valorant, Teamfight
          Tactics, and Wild Rift, along with associated esports and events.
          However, the company will halt new game development under Riot Forge
          and trim features in Legends of Runeterra, citing its underperformance
          relative to expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          While expressing pride in past achievements, particularly in bringing
          stories to life, Jadeja emphasized the necessity to redirect efforts
          toward Riot&apos;s ongoing ambitious projects. Riot Games, a
          subsidiary of the Chinese tech giant Tencent, has gained recognition
          for its esports-centric popular franchises. In addition to game
          development, Riot expanded its reach into entertainment with the
          production of the Arcane TV show on Netflix. The company,
          headquartered in Los Angeles, boasts a workforce of over 4,500
          employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision to reduce staff at Riot Games coincides with recent
          layoffs at tech giants like Google and Amazon. The trend of downsizing
          has affected prominent developers such as ByteDance, Niantic, Epic
          Games, and Ubisoft. Analysts foresee further job cuts in the tech
          sector, with an estimated 7,500 positions eliminated since the
          beginning of the year. The evolving landscape indicates a broader
          industry response to economic challenges and shifting priorities
          within the gaming and tech sectors.

        <p>
          Beyond the single-player mode, Palworld has a multiplayer mode
          requiring teamwork to take on tough Pals and craft items to survive
          the harsh world. Gameplay involves base building like Minecraft, with
          the ability to loot other players&apos; bases and items.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can utilize enslaved Pals to construct bases, assign them tasks,
          force them to work, engage in farming, build houses and more. Each Pal
          has a distinct personality and food needs, suitable for different
          roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within just 8 hours of its early access launch on the popular Steam
          marketplace, Palworld sold over 1 million copies. Recently, some
          connectivity issues arose but developers quickly resolved them.
          Palworld has now surpassed Counter-Strike 2 as the game with the most
          concurrent players on the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the controversial new game Palworld, which allows
          capturing and exploiting Pokemon-like creatures, has seen immense
          immediate success, selling 3 million copies and becoming a top-played
          title globally shortly after launching. Its unique mix of
          Pokemon-style collection and open-world survival gameplay has
          resonated widely despite ethical concerns.

          The Peregrine lunar lander mission by Pittsburgh-based Astrobiotic has
          ended unsuccessfully. On Friday morning, the company lost contact with
          the spacecraft, which likely burned up in the atmosphere, sealing the
          fate of a doomed endeavor that faltered soon after launch. However,
          later that day, Japan&apos;s &quot;SLIM&quot; moon mission did manage
          to land, though it is also facing issues.
        </p>

          Peregrine&apos;s trajectory was set long before the loss of signal on
          Friday. It had launched on January 8th aboard the maiden flight of
          United Launch Alliance&apos;s Centaur rocket. The new Centaur rocket,
          a Boeing and Lockheed Martin joint venture, performed well. But
          shortly after Peregrine separated from the launch vehicle, it sprung a
          leak and spewed fuel.

        <p>
          The Astrobiotic mission was intended to be the first American soft
          landing on the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. After detecting the fuel
          leak, Astrobiotic pivoted the mission to operate more like a
          satellite. They tested Peregrine&apos;s scientific instruments and
          systems as it flew thousands of kilometers before directing it to burn
          up in Earth&apos;s atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          If successful, it would have been the first private soft lunar
          landing, following the Israeli Beresheet mission in 2019 and Japanese
          UTO mission in 2023 which did achieve crash landings on the surface.
          Unfortunately, Peregrine did not progress as far.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the same day as Peregrine&apos;s loss of signal, the Japan
          Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) confirmed its Smart Lander for
          Investigating Moon (SLIM) successfully touched down, making Japan the
          fifth nation to accomplice a soft lunar landing after the U.S., Soviet
          Union, China and India.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the mission dubbed the “moon sniper” for its precision 100 meter
          landing capability has run into problems. The spacecraft&apos;s solar
          cells are not generating any power.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAXA attempted some life-sustaining measures like switching off
          SLIM&apos;s heater, but the battery can only endure for a few hours on
          the moon&apos;s surface. JAXA hopes a change in sunlight angle will
          energize the solar panels again.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have been several moon missions in the last two years - Japan’s
          SLIM and Hakuto, Russia’s Luna-25, India&apos;s Chandrayaan-3,
          Peregrine and more, with varying outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This emphasizes the new space race and push to establish a sustained
          lunar presence. Once we have a moon base, it can propel missions
          deeper into space. While that future is distant, space technology has
          already benefited daily life with smartphone cameras, memory foam
          mattresses and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, advancements may enable connecting directly to satellite networks
          using just smartphones, without specialized hardware like satellite
          terminals or phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google, AT&T and Vodafone have invested over $155 million in AST
          SpaceMobile to develop direct-to-device satellite connectivity. In
          2023, the company demonstrated 2G, 4G and 5G calls and 14 Mbps
          downloads directly from a satellite to regular smartphones using those
          companies&apos; networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google will collaborate on product development, testing and
          implementation to enable SpaceMobile connectivity for Android devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while the two recent moon missions had different fates, the
          constant push to explore space will continue advancing technology that
          improves life on Earth too. Focus on the cosmos beyond will lead to
          innovations that enrich our world.

          WhatsApp has rolled out several new capabilities for its Channels
          feature to improve engagement between brands, celebrities, public
          figures and their audiences on the platform. Introduced in late 2022,
          Channels enables direct communication from these users to their
          followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted four key additions to WhatsApp
          Channels - voice messages, polls, multiple admins and content sharing
          to Status. These updates, now out of testing, will be available to all
          users soon on an unspecified date.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major change allows Channel admins to send voice messages. This
          provides a quick, personal way to share behind-the-scenes insights,
          make announcements and directly interact with followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The addition of polls gives admins a handy tool to gather opinions and
          feedback from their audience on various topics, driving greater
          participation. Support for multiple Channel admins will be invaluable
          for large brands or organizations needing active management and prompt
          responses to incoming messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, followers can now share interesting Channel updates to their
          own WhatsApp Status. This viral feature expands the potential reach of
          content beyond the Channel&apos;s existing followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, these enhancements signal WhatsApp&apos;s efforts to make
          Channels a more engaging, interactive destination for both admins and
          their communities. With voice, polls, co-administration and built-in
          sharing, WhatsApp has meaningfully expanded Channels&apos;
          capabilities since launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          For public figures, brands and businesses, these features optimize
          Channels as a controlled space to foster direct conversations with
          followers at scale. Voice messages bring an authentic, personal touch
          while polls provide data-driven insights into audience preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ability to have multiple authenticated admins prevents bottlenecks
          in engaging active communities, while viral sharing of content helps
          expand visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          For followers, the updates make Channels a richer source of exclusive
          insights directly from the source. The additions encourage
          participating rather than just observing passive content.
        </p>
        <p>
          As WhatsApp continues developing Channels into a robust platform,
          these user-empowering features will significantly boost the appeal and
          utility for both creators and their communities seeking closer
          connections on WhatsApp.
