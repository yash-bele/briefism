          Artificial intelligence research company OpenAI has unveiled its new
          GPT Store, a marketplace specifically for personalized AI
          applications, as announced in the startup&apos;s blog on Wednesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPT Store is integrated within OpenAI&apos;s wildly popular
          ChatGPT conversational chatbot. It allows users to explore and build
          customized GPTs, which are AI models trained for specific tasks like
          teaching math concepts or designing stickers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPT Store represents OpenAI&apos;s efforts to capitalize on
          ChatGPT&apos;s phenomenal consumer success in introducing the world to
          advanced generative AI capabilities last year. ChatGPT dazzled many
          with its human-like ability to generate written content, leading to
          exponential user growth, though engagement has slowed recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenAI stated that the GPT Store will initially only be available to
          paid ChatGPT subscribers over the next few months. Later, the company
          plans to add monetization features so GPT creators can potentially
          profit from their personalized AI models.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenAI first unveiled plans for the GPT Store back in November at its
          inaugural developer conference, with an intended launch by end of that
          month. However, in December, OpenAI chose to delay the launch to make
          more improvements based on user feedback regarding early GPT
          experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          This delay also followed internal turmoil surrounding the sudden
          removal and quick reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman by the board,
          after mass employee resignations were threatened in protest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, OpenAI announced the launch of ChatGPT Team on
          Wednesday. This is a paid enterprise version of ChatGPT that companies
          can use internally while keeping their data private and segregated.
          ChatGPT Team is priced between $25-$30 per user monthly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full public launch of the GPT Store represents the next phase in
          OpenAI&apos;s efforts to keep building on ChatGPT&apos;s enormous
          early success and deliver personalized AI to mainstream consumers and
          businesses.
