        Microsoft is preparing to add more AI-powered features to its next
        Surface PC lineup. The upcoming computers, known by the code name
        CADMUS, are anticipated to be powered by a next-generation neural
        processing unit and offered in both Intel and ARM variants.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to a report by Windows Central&apos;s Zac Bowden that cites
        anonymous sources, the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 will be
        powered by Qualcomm&apos;s newest Snapdragon X chips, while the
        Intel-powered models will be powered by the company&apos;s 14th
        generation processors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thanks to the new NPU chips, these upcoming PCs will be able to run the
        AI features that Microsoft plans to include in its next major Windows
        release. Reportedly, the hardware will also bring it up to speed with
        Apple silicon by greatly improving features like security and battery
        life.
        <br />
        <br />
        The report also includes details on the Surface Laptop 6, which will now
        have a 13.8-inch screen rather than a 13.5-inch screen and a rounded
        display with thinner bezels, similar to the Surface Pro 10. There might
        also be a touchpad with haptic feedback and a dedicated button for
        Microsoft Copilot, the business&apos;s AI-powered chatbot.
        <br />
        <br />
        There may be two USB-C ports, a Surface Connect port for charging, and a
        USB-A port for connectivity on the Surface Laptop 6. It&apos;s possible
        that the Surface Pro 10 will be released in the spring of 2024 and cost
        the same as its predecessor. Microsoft also intends to release an
        updated Surface Pro and a Surface Laptop Studio in 2025.

        Soon, the backups of your WhatsApp conversations will begin to use up
        storage space on your GDrive. Last month, the business revised its terms
        and conditions for Android devices, but it did not specify when the
        changes will take effect.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Verge, however, has reported that WhatsApp has already rolled out
        the updates to users on the app&apos;s beta version. This implies that
        regardless of whether a user is using the free or paid plan, WhatsApp
        backup—which includes chat history, photos, and videos—will now be
        counted against their GDrive storage. The messaging app owned by Meta
        further stated that all Android users of WhatsApp will be affected by
        the change in the first half of 2024 and that they will be informed
        thirty days in advance. The alert will appear as a banner in the
        app&apos;s &quot;Chat&quot; settings under &quot;Chat Backup.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        If you wish to transfer all of your app-related data to a new device but
        don&apos;t want to backup your WhatsApp chat on GDrive, you can use the
        built-in WhatsApp Chat Transfer tool. This tool doesn&apos;t need an
        active internet connection to function, but it does require both phones
        to be connected to the same Wi-Fi.
        <br />
        <br />
        The app has an option that lets you back up just text messages without
        images or videos, which will help you save a ton of space on GDrive if
        you still want to use it to back up your WhatsApp chats. For quite some
        time now, Android users have benefited from the fact that WhatsApp chat
        backups do not count against their GDrive storage space. However, iPhone
        users have not had the same luxury, as the tech giant only provides 5GB
        of cloud storage for free.

        Here we are in 2024. Instead of texting or sending pictures, consider
        sending stickers as a WhatsApp wish to your friends, family, and
        coworkers. Along with advice on how to make the most of WhatsApp&apos;s
        New Year-themed sticker messages, here are some of the best &quot;Happy
        New Year 2024&quot; stickers that are worth sharing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meta has launched a collection of over 17 animated stickers on WhatsApp
        featuring a unique New Year&apos;s 2024 theme. BUCK created the sticker
        set with the idea of &quot;ringing in 2024 with your favorite people
        near and far.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        To obtain the sticker pack for WhatsApp at no cost, click the emoji icon
        in the conversation window and then select the + icon. The sticker pack
        will download as a result. Moreover, you may utilize WhatsApp to create
        a sticker out of a customized picture.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can use WhatsApp Web to upload your favorite photo with a New
        Year&apos;s theme and utilize it to make a bespoke sticker. Once
        created, the sticker can be viewed on tablets, smartphones, and the
        WhatsApp website.
        <br />
        <br />
        To enhance your WhatsApp &quot;Happy New Year 2024&quot; wishes, think
        about using third-party sticker apps like Sticker.ly, which offer an
        abundance of New Year-themed sticker packs.

        Google announced in 2020 that it would discontinue support for the
        Assistant Driving Mode on Maps. When using this feature, users may see a
        &quot;Dashboard&quot; on their home screen with media recommendations,
        audio settings, and shortcuts for calling and texting. Android Auto was
        designed to replace it on phone screens. Most clients, however, thought
        it was a downturn. As a result, Google Maps for Android now includes an
        enhanced UI called &quot;Driving Mode.&quot; However, it is expected
        that this feature will be removed by 2024.
        <br />
        <br />
        Google Maps will be discontinued in February 2024, according to code
        strings discovered in the most recent version of the Google app (version
        14.52), as reported by 9to5Google.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unlike the &quot;Assistant Driving Mode Dashboard&quot; option, Google
        Maps&apos; Driving Mode is accessible after you begin driving
        navigation. It&apos;s easy to access thanks to the Assistant, Google
        Maps, and a launcher for compatible music, podcasts, audiobooks, and
        other streaming apps. It appears as a black bar at the bottom of the
        screen on the phone. An enhanced media user interface (UI) with large
        touch targets is displayed in this mode.
        <br />
        <br />
        Speaking of it&apos;s impact on users - Google announced in 2022 that it
        would be focusing on Maps Driving Mode. The company discovered that most
        users preferred this method over the Dashboard. Instead, Google may
        recommend that users use &quot;Hey Google, launch driving mode&quot; to
        access the Google Maps navigation mode. In June, this feature was
        updated to allow Assistant to enable faster voice input.

        Nine offshore providers of virtual digital assets have received
        compliance show-cause notices from Financial Intelligence Unit-India,
        part of the Indian Finance Ministry, and have been instructed to block
        their URLs by the information technology ministry. Due to their illegal
        operations within the nation and disregard for the local money
        laundering regulations, these companies have received notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        The finance ministry released a statement stating that in order to
        operate in India, offshore and onshore virtual digital asset service
        providers must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India and
        adhere to the rules of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA),
        2002.
        <br />
        <br />
        For those who don&apos;t know, The national organization in charge of
        gathering, examining, and distributing information about questionable
        financial transactions to law enforcement authorities and their
        international counterparts is the Financial Intelligence Unit-India.
