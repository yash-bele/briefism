          Google has unveiled the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in a stylish new mint
          green color, a departure from the conventional black, hazel, and rose
          gold choices. While the vibrant &quot;bay&quot; blue 8 Pro option is
          more vivid, the mint green hue adds a refreshing touch to the regular
          Pixel 8 lineup. This new color option, exclusively available with the
          base 128GB storage for both models, gives Pixel enthusiasts a chance
          to step away from the conventional color choices that have been
          prevalent since the phone&apos;s release in October.
        </p>
        <p>
          Described as &quot;inspired by the vibrant hue found in nature&quot;
          and touted as a &quot;luminous color that invites the mind into a
          state of energizing calmness,&quot; mint is Google&apos;s bold attempt
          to infuse a sense of daring, focus, and optimism into the new year.
          The promotional materials suggest it&apos;s a color for those aiming
          for a &quot;fresher version of you.&quot; The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro,
          equipped with Google&apos;s latest Tensor G3 chipset, promise
          efficient and fast performance. Paired with UFS 4.0 storage, users can
          access their files swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of photography, the Pixel 8 features a 50-megapixel main
          camera with advanced Octa-PD technology for excellent low-light
          performance. It also boasts an 8x Super-Res digital zoom for capturing
          distant subjects, along with a 12-megapixel sensor for detailed
          close-up shots. For selfies and video calls, the front camera is a
          10.5-megapixel shooter. The Pixel 8 houses a 4,575mAh battery,
          ensuring a full day&apos;s usage, and supports 27W fast wired charging
          and 18W wireless charging.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the Pixel 8 Pro offers a 6.7-inch QHD+ OLED display
          with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for added durability. It features a
          10.5-megapixel selfie camera and a powerful trio of rear cameras,
          including a 50-megapixel main camera, a new 48-megapixel ultrawide
          sensor, and a 48-megapixel 5x zoom camera. The design of the Pixel 8
          Pro combines glass and metal, reminiscent of the previous Pixel 7 Pro.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the hood, the Pixel 8 Pro runs on the Google Tensor G3 chip and
          packs a 5,050mAh battery. It supports 30W wired charging and 23W
          wireless charging. Notable features include a Titan security chip for
          enhanced security, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The phone also
          includes a temperature monitoring sensor and an ultrasonic in-display
          fingerprint scanner.
        </p>
        <p>
          A unique addition to the Pixel 8 Pro is the Melexis MLX90632 skin
          temperature sensor, positioned near the cameras. Dedicated solely to
          accurate temperature readings and not enhancing photography, this
          feature could have various practical applications beyond traditional
          smartphone functions.

        <p>
          Swiggy is reportedly on the verge of downsizing its workforce, aiming
          to cut around 400 employees, which accounts for approximately 6
          percent of its total staff. This move comes as part of a strategic
          shift by the company and reflects a broader trend of major layoffs
          impacting technology firms globally. Here is a comprehensive overview
          of the situation:
        </p>
        <p>
          Swiggy&apos;s decision to lay off nearly 400 employees marks the
          second instance in the last 12 months, according to a report by Money
          Control. The impact is expected to be felt across various teams,
          including technology, call centers, and corporate roles. This
          strategic move is reportedly geared towards optimizing the
          company&apos;s operations and aligning its workforce with evolving
          business priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reports suggest that the layoffs will be implemented gradually over
          the next few weeks. This phased approach is aimed at facilitating a
          smoother transition while minimizing disruption to ongoing operations.
          However, details regarding whether severance pay would be provided to
          the impacted employees remain undisclosed at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year in January, Swiggy had undergone a similar process, laying
          off around 380 employees. At that time, the reasons cited included a
          slowdown in growth and overhiring. Interestingly, the current
          downsizing comes at a juncture when Swiggy is aggressively expanding
          its grocery delivery service, Swiggy Instamart. This shift suggests
          that the company is strategically realigning its workforce to enhance
          efficiency and better position itself in the competitive market.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Swiggy has not officially confirmed the latest round of layoffs,
          reports strongly indicate that the company is actively working on
          optimizing costs. This move is seen as a strategic step to showcase
          improved financials as Swiggy gears up for its Initial Public Offering
          (IPO). Swiggy&apos;s focus on cost optimization is in line with the
          broader trend of tech companies striving for financial robustness
          before entering public markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech industry is witnessing a season of layoffs, and Swiggy&apos;s
          move aligns with this trend. For instance, Microsoft has also
          announced a fresh round of layoffs affecting its gaming divisions,
          including Xbox and Blizzard. This indicates a collective industry-wide
          effort to adapt to changing dynamics and optimize operations for
          sustained growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, Swiggy&apos;s decision to trim its workforce reflects a
          dynamic business environment where companies are making strategic
          adjustments to stay competitive. As the tech industry undergoes
          transformations, optimizing operations and ensuring financial
          stability become crucial factors, and Swiggy&apos;s move appears to be
          in sync with these industry-wide imperatives.

        <p>
          When the Samsung Galaxy S24 series was unveiled recently, it
          introduced advanced AI features, many of which were developed in
          collaboration with Google. While several of these features were
          exclusively launched with the Galaxy S24 series, some, such as live
          transcribe in the Recording app and object remover in the Photos app,
          were already available on Pixel phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, Google collaborated with Samsung to bring certain features
          to the Galaxy S24 phones that were initially exclusive to Google.
          However, some features are entirely exclusive to Samsung phones, with
          not even the Pixel 8 series having access to them. Notably, features
          like Circle to Search, point and search with Google Lens, Live
          Translate, Magic Compose, and Android Auto integration are the
          outcomes of the partnership between Samsung and Google. The Samsung
          Galaxy S24 series heavily relies on Gemini AI, Google&apos;s new
          multimodal model system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galaxy S24 series incorporates Google&apos;s latest Gemini AI
          model, encompassing all three versions — Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra, and
          Gemini Nano — across various default applications on the smartphones.
          Specifically, the utilization of Gemini Pro on the Galaxy S24 series
          enhances interactions with Samsung apps, providing users with
          summarization and translation features in apps like Samsung Notes,
          Voice Recorder, and Keyboard. Additionally, Imagen 2 on the Galaxy S24
          series allows users to access Generative Edit features within the
          Samsung Gallery app.
        </p>
        <p>
          While these features are undoubtedly beneficial for the Galaxy S24
          series, it raises a question: Is Google, by collaborating with Samsung
          to embed AI features in its phones, potentially undermining its own
          Pixel phones?
        </p>
        <p>
          To some extent, yes. However, it&apos;s crucial to recognize that for
          Google, Pixels represent just a small component of its broader
          strategy. Google is a multinational corporation first and foremost,
          prioritizing profitability and the growth of its Android ecosystem.
          The collaboration with Samsung aligns with Google&apos;s overarching
          goal of expanding its Android ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deal with Samsung ensured that Gemini AI and Imagen 2 features,
          while exclusive to the Galaxy S24 series, were accessible to a broader
          audience. While keeping these features exclusive to Google Pixel could
          have provided some bragging rights, they wouldn&apos;t have reached as
          many users. Samsung also plans to roll out these features to the
          previous year&apos;s S23 series soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          For context, Samsung received over 250,000 pre-booking orders for the
          Galaxy S24 Ultra in India alone, and in 2023, the Galaxy S23 Ultra
          sold 11.63 million units. In comparison, Google sold a total of 10
          million units of both Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro phones in India
          throughout the entire previous year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prabhu Ram, who leads the Industry Intelligence Group at CyberMedia
          Research (CMR), provides insight into such deals between Samsung and
          Google. He explains, “By strategically sharing its AI features with
          other Android OEMs, such as Samsung, Google is casting a wider net ––
          unlocking new lucrative revenue streams through potential partnerships
          while also fueling the continuous refinement of its AI tech,
          ultimately benefiting not just Pixel users but the entire Android
          ecosystem.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Deals like these are not uncommon, as evidenced by recent revelations
          during Epic Games&apos; testimony that Google committed to paying
          Samsung $8 billion over four years. This financial arrangement aimed
          to establish Google Search, Google Assistant, and Play Store as
          default options on Samsung&apos;s mobile devices, similar to how
          Google pays Apple for the default search engine on iPhones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, the exposure of products like Gemini AI and Imagen 2
          expands significantly when they debut in devices like Samsung Galaxy
          flagship phones. While Google may have foregone exclusive features on
          the Pixel 8 series, the collaboration likely brought in substantial
          revenue, and a broader user base will contribute to enhancing its AI
          tools.

          Silicon Valley appears to be anticipating another wave of layoffs,
          with major tech companies announcing large-scale job cuts. Following
          Google, Meta, Amazon, and other Silicon Valley giants, Microsoft has
          now disclosed a new round of layoffs within its gaming division,
          encompassing Activision Blizzard and Xbox. Approximately 1,900 roles
          out of 22,000 will be affected, constituting around 8 percent of the
          overall Microsoft Gaming division. The job cuts coincide with the
          departure of a significant executive from Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft is Implementing Layoffs in its Gaming Division: Microsoft
          has recently declared a new round of job cuts within its gaming
          division, which encompasses Activision Blizzard and Xbox. The company
          is downsizing its gaming workforce by around 1,900 positions out of
          the 22,000 people in its team. This decision is part of an effort to
          streamline operations and concentrate on new projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer conveyed this information in an
          internal memo to employees, stating, &quot;As part of this process, we
          have made the painful decision to reduce the size of our gaming
          workforce by approximately 1,900 roles out of the 22,000 people on our
          team. The Gaming Leadership Team and I are committed to navigating
          this process as thoughtfully as possible.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Departures of Blizzard President and Chief Design Officer: The
          restructuring changes at Microsoft are impacting key figures within
          Blizzard, the game developer behind popular titles like World of
          Warcraft and Overwatch. Alongside the layoffs, Blizzard President Mike
          Ybarra and Chief Design Officer Allen Adham have opted to leave the
          company after playing crucial roles in leadership and innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft&apos;s game content and studios president, Matt Booty,
          confirmed these developments in an internal memo and announced that a
          new president for Blizzard would be appointed the following week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellation of Blizzard&apos;s Survival Game Project: As part of the
          organizational changes leading to layoffs and the resignation of key
          executives, Microsoft has decided to abandon a survival game project
          being developed by Blizzard. Booty mentioned that those involved in
          this project would be reassigned to other exciting opportunities in
          the early stages of development at Blizzard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft Extends Support to Impacted Employees: Microsoft has
          emphasized its commitment to navigating the layoff process
          thoughtfully and providing support to affected employees. Impacted
          individuals are being informed through meetings starting today. Those
          equipped to work from home and prefer to do so can work remotely.
          Microsoft expressed confidence in its team&apos;s ability to create
          and nurture games, stories, and worlds that bring players together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft Follows the Broader Trend of Tech Layoffs: Microsoft is not
          alone in downsizing its workforce, as other major tech companies have
          also resorted to layoffs recently, according to layoffs.fyi, a site
          tracking tech layoffs. Google, YouTube, Amazon, Meta, and TikTok have
          all announced job cuts in various departments, including hardware,
          engineering, media, film, and technical program management, affecting
          hundreds of employees. Reasons cited for these layoffs include the
          need to reorganize, focus on key projects, cope with the slowdown in
          ad revenue, and pursue new visions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The layoffs at Microsoft and other tech companies underscore the
          challenges and opportunities in the tech industry, impacted by the
          pandemic, the shift to cloud computing, the rise of automation, and
          the need for innovation. Microsoft aims to adapt to these changes and
          grow its business by bringing more games to players worldwide. The
          company last announced significant layoffs a year ago, affecting
          10,000 employees.

        <p>
          If you own an iPhone in Europe, significant changes are on the
          horizon. Apple has recently unveiled updates for European iPhone
          users, allowing them to download apps from sources beyond the
          traditional App Store. While this expansion provides users with more
          choices, Apple is also introducing additional safety measures to
          safeguard against potential risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The driving force behind these updates is the Digital Markets Act
          (DMA), a set of regulations mandating that Apple broaden options for
          European users and implement safeguards to protect them from potential
          hazards associated with new apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For users, these changes mean increased flexibility in installing apps
          from various sources, granting access to a wider array of applications
          on their iPhones. Essentially, this opens up more avenues for
          discovering both entertaining and practical applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers are also impacted positively by these updates. Apple is
          providing them with new tools to share their apps through alternative
          app stores and payment methods, offering greater flexibility. Safety
          for developers is enhanced through measures like Notarization, a
          process that verifies the safety of an app before it can be
          downloaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with these changes, potential risks emerge, such as the
          possibility of harmful or deceptive apps. In response, Apple is
          implementing safety measures, including a thorough app check
          (Notarization) to ensure apps are secure for iPhone users. Additional
          information about apps will be provided to users before downloading to
          enhance transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users who browse the internet using Safari on their iPhones will
          encounter a new screen prompting them to select their default browser.
          This adjustment is a result of the new rules Apple is obliged to
          follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          For developers selling apps in Europe, new payment handling options
          are introduced. Apple is giving them the choice to utilize different
          payment services and direct users to their websites for purchases. To
          keep users informed, Apple will include labels and information sheets
          whenever there are variations, allowing users to make informed
          decisions based on their comfort level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Apple is altering the revenue landscape for developers.
          Reduced fees for using the App Store are being offered, but developers
          must adhere to new business terms to avail themselves of these
          benefits. This signifies a shift in how developers can monetize their
          apps on Apple&apos;s platform.

          Samsung is actively pursuing the development of cutting-edge health
          sensors to rival Apple, as reported by Bloomberg&apos;s Mark Gurman.
          The company&apos;s goal is to incorporate noninvasive blood glucose
          monitoring and continuous blood pressure tracking across its product
          range.
        </p>
        <p>
          This initiative is part of Samsung&apos;s broader strategy to
          integrate advanced health features, exemplified by the recently
          unveiled Galaxy Ring smart ring. Hon Pak, a Samsung executive leading
          the health technology initiative, envisions providing consumers with a
          comprehensive overview of their well-being through sensors deployed on
          various body parts and within the home environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          During an interview, Pak emphasized the significance of achieving
          continuous blood pressure and glucose monitoring, recognizing it as a
          pivotal advancement. He stated, &quot;If we can do continuous blood
          pressure and glucose, we&apos;re in a whole different ballgame. I
          think that&apos;s where everyone is trying to get to. We&apos;re
          putting significant investment toward that.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s crucial to note that Apple has been actively working for
          years on developing a noninvasive glucose reader, a technology that
          holds immense potential benefits for diabetics. However, Pak refrains
          from providing a specific timeline for Samsung&apos;s
          technology&apos;s market debut, expressing optimism that some form of
          noninvasive glucose monitoring could become a reality within the next
          five years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Galaxy Ring, recently introduced by Samsung and set for release by
          the end of 2024, will initially focus on tracking activity and sleep.
          Additional health features are planned for future updates. The
          discreet form factor of the ring may appeal to individuals seeking
          health tracking in a less conspicuous device compared to smartwatches.
          While pricing details are yet to be finalized, the Galaxy Ring is
          expected to lack iPhone compatibility, unlike Samsung&apos;s watches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gurman highlights the challenges associated with creating a
          noninvasive blood sugar monitor, noting Apple&apos;s struggles despite
          a decade of effort. Samsung is also working on enhancing blood
          pressure tracking on its smartwatches, aiming for reduced calibration
          requirements. Pak underscores the goal of providing blood pressure
          assessments that focus more on indicating cardiovascular risk rather
          than providing precise values.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to smart rings and watches, Samsung is exploring the
          integration of new sensors into earbuds. These sensors could track
          temperature and heart rate, leveraging the ear canal&apos;s proximity
          to the heart for more accurate measurements. The data from earbuds,
          combined with wrist-based measurements and environmental factors, aims
          to offer a more holistic health overview.

          Apple is releasing the iOS 17.3 update, introducing notable features
          such as &apos;Stolen Device Protection&apos; and &apos;Collaborative
          Apple Music Playlists.&apos; This update aims to enhance security
          measures and offer new avenues for interactive music experiences.
          Let&apos;s delve into the key highlights of iOS 17.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">Stolen Device Protection:</span>{" "}
          Addressing iPhone theft concerns, Apple introduces the &apos;Stolen
          Device Protection&apos; feature. This security enhancement imposes
          additional safeguards when the device is in locations outside of

          Apple Music, access a playlist, and tap on the person icon. This
          action generates a shareable link, enabling others to join and add
          songs to the playlist. Additionally, users listening to collaborative
          playlists can express reactions with emojis, such as hearts or thumbs
          up, which animate when the corresponding song is played.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">AirPlay Support for Hotels:</span> In
          a move to enhance user experiences in select hotels, iOS 17.3
          introduces AirPlay support. Users with updated devices can now
          seamlessly stream content from Apple devices like iPads, iPhones, and
          Macs in hotels deemed compatible with AirPlay by Apple. This
          functionality enables users to enjoy content from various streaming
          platforms on larger screens within the hotel environment, using their
          individual credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-xl block">AppleCare Coverage Display:</span>{" "}
          Another notable addition in iOS 17.3 is the display of AppleCare
          coverage for all devices associated with a user&apos;s Apple account.
          This information is conveniently accessible under the &apos;AppleCare
          and Warranty&apos; section within the &apos;General&apos; tab in the
          Settings app. This feature provides users with a comprehensive
          overview of AppleCare coverage for all their signed-in devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the iOS 17.3 update signifies Apple&apos;s commitment
          to enhancing user security, collaboration in music experiences, and
          seamless content streaming in select hotel environments. With these
          new features, Apple continues to refine and enrich the user experience
          across its range of devices.
