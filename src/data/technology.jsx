          Truecaller has introduced its AI-driven call recording feature in
          India, now available for both iOS and Android users. This new tool
          enables users to record phone conversations directly within the
          Truecaller app, providing transcription and summary generation
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Utilizing artificial intelligence technology, Truecaller offers live
          call transcription, allowing users to concentrate fully on the
          conversation without the need for note-taking. After the call
          concludes, Truecaller&apos;s AI automatically generates a
          transcription of the entire conversation along with a convenient
          summary.

          Japan&apos;s inaugural moon lander has responded to an Earth signal,
          indicating its survival through a second frigid lunar night, as
          announced by Japan&apos;s space agency on Monday.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAXA referred to the signal received late Sunday as a
          &quot;miracle&quot; since the probe was not originally designed to
          endure the lunar night, characterized by temperatures plummeting to
          minus 170 degrees Celsius (minus 274 degrees Fahrenheit).

          The spacecraft, known as the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon
          (SLIM), executed a precise touchdown on Jan. 20, marking Japan as the
          fifth nation to successfully deploy a probe on the moon.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, upon landing, the probe found itself inverted, hindering its
          solar panels&apos; ability to access sunlight initially, resulting in
          a shutdown within hours. SLIM regained power on the eighth day
          post-landing, upon exposure to sunlight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over subsequent days, SLIM gathered geological data from lunar rocks
          before entering a hibernation period in late January to endure another
          lunar night.
        </p>
        <p>
          JAXA mentioned that Sunday&apos;s communication was brief as it was
          still &quot;lunar midday,&quot; with SLIM experiencing high
          temperatures of about 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit). The agency
          is preparing to re-establish contact once the vehicle has cooled down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists are eager to analyze moon rock mineral compositions to
          unravel clues about the moon&apos;s origins, comparing them with those
          of Earth.

          As a child, I found computers peculiar, yet as I matured, that initial
          strangeness dissipated. Despite my nostalgia for 90s computers,
          Lenovo&apos;s unveiling of a transparent laptop promises to transport
          me into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I had the opportunity to
          explore Lenovo&apos;s proof-of-concept ThinkBook laptop, featuring a
          transparent display akin to augmented reality. Interacting with the
          device evoked mixed emotions about its innovative positioning.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full h-72 sm:h-96 bg-slate-200 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

          Upon finally accessing the demo unit, the experience was unlike any
          familiar laptop usage. The device resembled a single piece of glass,
          with floating Windows icons and cursor movements resembling mid-air
          interaction, akin to using an AR headset. While intriguing, grasping
          the concept of a transparent screen laptop required more time to
          acclimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standout feature of the device is its 17.3-inch MicroLED
          transparent display, boasting 55% transparency. Although visible from
          behind, the display becomes less transparent as pixels illuminate,
          lending a magical, dystopian aesthetic to the user experience. Despite
          its allure, the laptop&apos;s bulkiness contrasts sharply with the
          sleekness of a MacBook Air, featuring a dual-screen design with a
          capacitive touchscreen and trackpad on the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon further exploration, I discovered that the keyboard functions as
          a projection that vanishes when a stylus approaches or when the user
          steps away, transforming the secondary touchscreen into a drawing
          surface. Additionally, a camera positioned below the display hinge
          facilitates object identification and generative AI, displaying
          relevant information about objects placed behind the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Lenovo ThinkBook Transparent laptop demo impressed, it
          remains far from retail availability. Questions regarding its
          practicality and user experience must be addressed, especially
          considering the limited resolution of the MicroLED panel, currently
          restricted to HD quality. Lenovo acknowledges the challenge of
          achieving Full HD resolution on a transparent display, underscoring
          the need for further development before market release.

          Apple&apos;s recently launched Vision Pro headset is undergoing
          rigorous testing, revealing a surprising level of durability. Sam Kohl
          from AppleTrack, a tech YouTube channel, subjected the futuristic
          wearable to various forms of abuse, including intentional drops,
          collisions with walls, and bumps.

          The Vision Pro&apos;s glass demonstrated remarkable resilience to
          everyday wear and tear, surviving intentional impacts against walls
          with only minor scuffs and no shattering. The front panel proved
          exceptionally sturdy, withstanding multiple drops from considerable
          heights. Even with the headset&apos;s weight of 600 to 650 grams, it
          took eight high falls to eventually cause the front glass to splinter.
          Notably, the twin internal and external screens continued to function
          properly despite the damaged cover.

          However, the peripheral speakers faced challenges during the
          durability tests. One speaker ceased to function after several impacts
          against the wall, and the connections to the headband eventually
          broke, leading to a loss of power. The lightweight magnetic light
          seals also tended to detach easily upon impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these issues, the overall durability of the Vision Pro
          impressed, showcasing resilience to reasonable mishaps. It should be
          noted that while the front glass demonstrated strength, repairing a
          damaged screen comes with a significant cost. Without AppleCare, the
          repair is priced at $799, and with the protection plan, it is $299.
          For other damages, Apple quotes up to $2,399, emphasizing the
          importance of handling the headset with care to avoid potential repair
          expenses.
