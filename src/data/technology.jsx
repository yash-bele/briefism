          The highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event is taking place
          today in San Jose, where the tech giant is expected to unveil its most
          advanced lineup of smartphones yet - the Galaxy S24 series. This new
          generation of Galaxy S devices promises major upgrades and
          improvements over their predecessors, making them Samsung&apos;s most
          powerful smartphones to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event is being held at the SAP Center in San Jose, California and
          starts at 1 PM EST for US audiences, while Indian viewers can tune in
          from 11:30 PM IST onwards. Samsung is live streaming the launch on
          their official YouTube channel and social media platforms like
          Facebook, ensuring global accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those interested in following the event through Samsung&apos;s
          official website have the chance to win a INR 5,000 voucher to spend
          on Samsung products. Additionally, by pre-paying INR 1,999, you can
          reserve a spot to be one of the first to purchase the new Galaxy S24
          smartphones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumors suggest that the Galaxy S24+ may be priced between INR 1,04,999
          and INR 1,05,999 for the base 12GB RAM and 256GB storage model. This
          indicates a significant price jump of over INR 10,000 compared to last
          year&apos;s Galaxy S23+ which was priced at INR 94,999.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top-of-the-line Galaxy S24 Ultra is speculated to cost between INR
          1,34,999 and INR 1,35,999 for the same configuration. Again, this is
          approximately INR 10,000 more than the S23 Ultra&apos;s starting price
          of INR 1,24,999. Samsung appears to be considering a price hike for
          its flagship S series, although leaked information implies the company
          may retain existing prices. We will have to wait for official
          confirmation during the launch event.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no available information yet regarding the pricing of the
          standard Galaxy S24. For reference, the S23 was launched at INR 74,999
          last year. Samsung may continue the same starting price for the base
          S24 model, limiting the price increases to the S24+ and S24 Ultra
          only. This mirrors Apple&apos;s strategy with its recent iPhone 15
          lineup.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India, pre-reservations for the Galaxy S24 series have already
          commenced on Samsung&apos;s official website. With powerful upgrades,
          new AI capabilities, and potentially higher prices, Samsung aims to
          position the S24 series as its most premium smartphone range ever.
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-1.5">
          <span className="text-xl">Key highlights expected include:</span>
          <ul className="space-y-1.5 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>

            Circle to Search: Convenient Cross-App Queries

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              This Android feature enables searching anything on-screen without
              switching apps. Users can simply long press the home or navigation
              button then highlight an object with tap, circle, scribble, etc.
              to view contextual information within the app itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if an influencer shows untagged fashion items, circle
              them to instantly find and shop similar styles from various
              retailers. Once done, swipe back to the original app.
            </p>
            <p>
              As per Google, AI upgrades like multisearch (text and image
              queries) already help users grasp concepts and topics by
              aggregating helpful web information. Circle to Search brings that
              convenience directly into any app. It launches first on select
              premium Android devices like the Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Galaxy
              S24 series.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;Circle to Search significantly advances expressing needs
              conveniently without changing contexts. Combined with multisearch,
              it enables more intuitive, natural search,&quot; said Alistair
              Pott, Google&apos;s Director of Android Search Product Management.

              Users can now point their camera at anything, snap a picture, or
              upload a screenshot to ask a visual question. This utilizes
              generative AI to instantly provide overview insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially available in the US without needing Search Labs
              enrollment, this feature previews in other regions by accessing
              overviews via Circle to Search.

              Google states this allows more nuanced visual queries to swiftly
              obtain key information. As gen AI applications prove helpful,
              Google will incorporate them into mainstream Search, starting with
              multisearch results.

              These user-centric search innovations also employ Google&apos;s

              remains on device until explicitly sent to Google post-selection.

            <p>
              Moreover, the last 15 minutes of search history can be easily

            <p>
              &quot;When you activate Circle to Search, everything occurs on
              device - we&apos;re scanning what you&apos;re viewing but it
              remains there. Only after explicit selection is anything sent to
              Google for search. We also enabled quickly removing the last 15
              minutes of search history,&quot; Pott explained.
