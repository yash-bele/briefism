          The iPhone 16 Pro Max currently stands as Apple&apos;s top-tier
          device, yet for those seeking a more compact option, the upcoming
          iPhone SE appears to be the sole alternative, especially after Apple
          discontinued its &apos;mini&apos; series last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interest in Apple&apos;s &apos;mini&apos; series had waned notably
          with the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini registering the lowest
          sales figures for the company. Nonetheless, Apple seems poised to
          introduce the iPhone SE 4, poised to usher in several enhancements.
          From a contemporary buttonless design to a larger screen, here&apos;s
          what we know about the upcoming iPhone SE so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rumors suggest that the iPhone SE 4 will boast a larger 6.1-inch
          display, a departure from the iPhone SE 2022&apos;s compact 4.7-inch
          screen. This shift potentially signals Apple&apos;s move away from
          phones smaller than 5 inches. Leaked renders by 91mobiles indicate
          that Apple may also swap the Touch ID button for Face ID
          authentication, alongside adopting a notch akin to the iPhone 13 and
          iPhone 14 series.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier this month, dummy images of the iPhone SE 4 surfaced courtesy
          of known tipster Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter), hinting at wireless
          charging support via MagSafe and a 6.1-inch OLED screen with FullHD
          resolution. A report by MacRumors suggests that the iPhone SE 4,
          codenamed Ghost, could resemble the base model iPhone 14, adopting a
          modified version of its chassis instead of the curvier edges seen on
          the iPhone 15 series.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the current-gen iPhone SE runs on Apple&apos;s Bionic A15
          chipset, debuted with the iPhone 13 series, the iPhone SE 4 is rumored
          to feature the swifter A16 Bionic, also found in the iPhone 14 Pro and
          non-pro models of the iPhone 15.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for photography enthusiasts, reports suggest mixed news. While the
          iPhone SE 4 may retain a single camera setup akin to its predecessor,
          speculation hints at a potential upgrade to a 48MP sensor, a
          significant boost from the current iPhone SE 2022&apos;s 12MP shooter.
          Although earlier suggestions by Majin Bu pointed towards a 12MP
          ultrawide lens, recent case designs reportedly for the iPhone SE 4
          suggest a single 48MP camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reports indicate that the iPhone SE 4 remains in the early stages of
          development, with anticipated launch slated for next year. Regarding
          pricing, expectations suggest a notable increase due to Apple&apos;s
          inclusion of its latest chipset and implementation of a more modern
          design alongside Face ID support.

          Wireless earbuds today prioritize snug fits, compactness, and features
          like active noise cancellation (ANC) and transparency mode. However,
          the concept of totally wireless earbuds (TWS) initially revolved
          around convenience. The original AirPods and even today&apos;s basic
          models aim to deliver quality audio in a convenient, user-friendly
          form factor. With advancing technology, basic TWS are becoming
          increasingly scarce, especially in budget segments where accommodating
          additional features can be a luxury. While the latest AirPods (3rd
          Generation) offer a rich audio experience, their price of nearly Rs
          18,000 might deter some, pushing consumers to explore alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enter the Nothing Ear (Stick), released by Carl Pei&apos;s Nothing
          venture in late 2022. These TWS bear striking resemblance to the OG
          AirPods in design and functionality, emphasizing convenience and ease
          of use. Initially criticized for their price of Rs 8,499, the Ear
          (Stick) TWS have now become available for less than half that amount,
          selling at around Rs 3,999. At this price, they offer a compelling
          option for those seeking good, basic TWS with decent audio quality,
          without unnecessary bells and whistles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ear (Stick) TWS boasts an eye-catching design that won the RedDot
          design award in 2023. Encased in a transparent cylindrical case
          resembling a lipstick, the buds feature transparent stems with visible
          circuitry and white bulbous tops. Designed to hang from the ears
          rather than fit inside them, they prioritize comfort. Weighing just
          over four grams each, the buds and their 46-gram case are highly
          portable.
        </p>
        <p>
          With IP54 dust and water resistance, the Ear (Stick) TWS offer
          protection from splashes of water. Their on-ear design, which allows
          some sound to pass through, ensures comfortable wear, making them
          suitable for various activities, including exercise. Performance-wise,
          these TWS connect via Bluetooth and work seamlessly with both iPhones
          and Android devices. Powered by 12.6 mm drivers, they deliver good
          sound quality, with a slightly bass-heavy output. The Nothing X app
          offers an excellent equalizer, allowing users to customize the audio
          according to their preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple controls, centered around pinching and holding the stems of the
          buds, make operation intuitive. Each bud&apos;s stem features pinch
          controls, with the left bud controlling volume and the right bud
          handling playback and call functions. The absence of controls on the
          buds themselves minimizes displacement during use.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Ear (Stick) TWS allow some external sound to pass through,
          they excel in call quality and Bluetooth connectivity. With reliable
          ear detection, the buds pause and resume audio playback when removed
          and reinserted. They also boast impressive battery life, offering
          around seven hours of playback on a single charge and up to 28 hours
          with the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite lacking ANC and additional features found in higher-priced
          TWS, the Ear (Stick) TWS offer a blend of smart features and solid
          performance at an attractive price point. Their recent price reduction
          enhances their value proposition, making them a compelling choice for
          consumers seeking hassle-free calls and reliable performance. As
          rumors circulate about their impending discontinuation, interested
          buyers may want to act swiftly to secure a pair before they&apos;re
          gone.

        <p>
          The upcoming total solar eclipse on Monday is often dubbed a
          &quot;once-in-a-lifetime&quot; occurrence, and understandably so. Such
          events are exceptionally rare, with certain regions only experiencing
          them once in centuries. Even for those fortunate enough to be within
          the eclipse&apos;s path, totality lasts a mere four minutes at most,
          contingent upon weather conditions. Consequently, some individuals opt
          to pursue the eclipse via jet planes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exploring the rarity of total eclipses, it&apos;s evident that while
          two to five solar eclipses transpire annually in various parts of the
          world, total solar eclipses occur approximately every 18 months.
          However, their visibility is limited to a fraction of the Earth&apos;s
          surface, confined to the umbra, the Moon&apos;s darkest shadow. Given
          the vastness of the globe, coupled with substantial expanses of
          uninhabited land and vast oceans, the likelihood of witnessing a total
          solar eclipse firsthand is minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
          This scarcity poses a considerable challenge for scientists eager to
          gather invaluable data during such events. Total eclipses offer a
          unique opportunity to study the Sun&apos;s corona, its outer
          atmosphere, which becomes more observable as the Moon obstructs the
          Sun&apos;s face. Additionally, these occurrences provide insight into
          how solar radiation influences Earth&apos;s atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, conducting ground-based scientific observations during an
          eclipse is fraught with uncertainty, particularly regarding cloud
          cover. To circumvent this obstacle, NASA has devised an innovative
          solution: deploying scientific instruments aboard its WB-57 jet planes
          to chase the eclipse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three NASA-funded teams will utilize these aircraft to conduct
          research during the eclipse, with two teams focusing on capturing
          corona data and the third measuring the ionosphere, Earth&apos;s
          electrically charged upper atmosphere. Flying at altitudes exceeding
          15,000 meters, these jets will soar above cloud cover and atmospheric
          interference, enabling enhanced imaging capabilities and the capture
          of additional wavelengths of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the WB-57s&apos; rapid speed of 750 kilometers per hour
          ensures prolonged observation periods. While ground-based viewers are
          limited to observing totality for approximately four and a half
          minutes, instruments aboard the planes will have an extended
          observation window of 6 minutes and 22 seconds. This isn&apos;t the
          first time NASA has employed jet aircraft for eclipse research; a
          similar endeavor was undertaken in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the utilization of jet planes to pursue solar eclipses
          offers scientists a unique vantage point unhindered by terrestrial
          obstacles, facilitating comprehensive research and data collection
          during these extraordinary celestial events.

          Smartwatches have long been admired for their myriad features, but the
          perpetual challenge of balancing increased battery capacity with
          processor efficiency has hindered their overall performance.
          Typically, as battery capacity increases, the devices become bulkier,
          while more complex operating systems contribute to power-hungry
          processors, resulting in most smartwatches barely lasting a couple of
          days on a single charge. However, the introduction of the Wear OS
          Hybrid Interface seeks to address this longstanding issue and provide
          users with an optimal balance between enhanced features and prolonged
          battery life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="block text-xl">
            Understanding Wear OS Hybrid Interface:
          </span>
          The Wear OS Hybrid Interface represents Google&apos;s solution to the
          persistent battery life problem that has plagued Wear OS devices.
          While non-Wear OS watches, such as Garmin smartwatches, can last over
          100 hours, Wear OS devices have struggled to achieve comparable
          longevity. This innovative software solution operates within Wear OS,
          intelligently managing the internal processors of smartwatches. Many
          modern Wear OS smartwatches employ a &quot;dual-chipset
          architecture,&quot; featuring a robust main processor (Application
          Processor or AP) and a low-power processor (Microcontroller Unit or
          MCU). Google&apos;s Wear OS Hybrid Interface optimizes battery usage
          by allocating specific tasks to either the high-power or low-power
          chip, effectively putting Wear OS into hibernation when the watch is
          not in active use.

          Google explains the Wear OS Hybrid Interface as follows: &quot;The
          Wear OS hybrid interface enables intelligent switching between the MCU
          or the AP, allowing the AP to be suspended when not needed to preserve
          battery life. It helps achieve more power-efficient experiences, like
          sensor data processing on the MCU while the AP is asleep, providing a
          seamless transition between power states to maintain a rich and
          premium user experience.&quot;

            Wear OS Hybrid in Action: OnePlus Watch 2 Case Study:
          </span>
          Examining the recently launched OnePlus Watch 2 provides insight into
          the practical application of the Wear OS Hybrid Interface. This
          smartwatch combines Wear OS, powered by the Snapdragon W5 chipset, and
          an RTOS running on the BES 2700. The main app processor remains
          dormant while the low-power co-processor handles basic functions like
          displaying notifications and watch faces. The main chip activates only
          for more resource-intensive tasks. While users have the option to
          force the main processor to handle all tasks for maximum smoothness,
          the co-processor performs exceptionally well on its own. This dynamic
          mirrors the efficiency of Android phones, which allocate tasks to
          low-energy cores for simple functions and shift demanding tasks to
          power cores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transition between processors occurs seamlessly, without requiring
          manual adjustments or power mode changes. Notably, developers do not
          need to optimize their apps for the Wear OS Hybrid Interface, as Wear
          OS APIs now handle all necessary work and optimization. The
          responsibility for leveraging this technology rests with the watch
          manufacturer, necessitating the use of appropriate hardware and
          adherence to specified software customization principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="block text-xl">
            Impressive Results and Future Prospects:
          </span>
          The effectiveness of Wear OS Hybrid Interface is evident in the
          impressive results observed in the OnePlus Watch 2. In a comprehensive
          review, the watch demonstrated a battery life of four days with the
          always-on display active, closely aligning with the promised 100 hours
          of battery life. There is even potential for the watch to surpass this
          figure with the always-on display turned off. Additionally, the watch
          offers a power saver mode, extending battery life to an extraordinary
          12 days by utilizing only the low-powered chip for all tasks. However,

          The wave of layoffs in the US tech industry shows no signs of abating,
          impacting companies across the spectrum from giants to startups. Over
          the first two months of 2024, approximately 193 companies have cut
          nearly 50,000 jobs, with an additional 500 employees laid off by seven
          companies in March alone. The relentless pace of organizational
          restructuring raises concerns for millions of tech professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent report from AuthorityHacker unveils the heightened anxiety
          levels among workers, with 54.58% expressing worry about potential job
          losses, and the tech sector bearing the brunt of this distress.
          Specifically, IT-Services and Data (89.66%) and Software Development
          (74.42%) professionals report the highest levels of concern regarding
          job security.
        </p>
        <p>
          The surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology compounds
          employee apprehension, with 72.42% expressing unease about AI&apos;s
          impact on their jobs over the next five years. Notably, nearly half
          (48.28%) of respondents strongly believe that AI will adversely affect
          their job security. C-level executives (85%) and Directors (78.83%)
          emerge as the most apprehensive groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Breaking down concerns by company size, the report underscores that
          employees in mid-sized companies (500-1000 employees) feel
          particularly vulnerable, with 74.33% sensing a higher risk of job
          loss. Sectors heavily reliant on computers, such as Software (67.44%),
          finance (67.75%), and Human Resources (64.29%), express heightened
          anxiety about job security. In contrast, sectors centered on human
          interactions, like education (43.04%) and real estate (44.68%),
          exhibit lower concern regarding AI&apos;s impact on jobs. The survey,
          conducted on 1,200 full-time employees across the US, reveals a
          nuanced landscape of job insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          While fears about AI-induced job displacement loom large, it is
          essential to recognize the potential for creating new opportunities. A
          recent World Economic Forum report predicts that AI could generate up
          to 97 million new roles by 2025. The imperative lies in acquiring AI
          skills to adapt to the evolving job market.
        </p>
        <p>
          To weather the AI wave, professionals should integrate AI tools into
          daily operations, emphasize interpersonal skills like communication
          and empathy, cultivate professional networks, and nurture specialized
          expertise and personal branding. Studies suggest that a significant
          majority of executives anticipate AI to augment rather than replace
          job roles, highlighting the pivotal role of AI upskilling in
          mitigating unemployment risks.
