          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Despite no changes to exterior styling, the 2024 Astor&apos;s
              updates make it more in tune with user needs and preferences. The
              new wireless charging and enhanced voice controls cater perfectly
              to today&apos;s smartphone-centric users. Safety has also been
              augmented via auto-dimming IRVMs. And existing owners can enjoy
              these benefits via OTA software updates as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The midsize SUV space is ultra-competitive with models like
              Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, VW Taigun, Skoda Kushaq and Maruti
              Suzuki Grand Vitara. By injecting freshness via these new features
              rather than just superficial styling changes, MG has made the
              Astor more compelling in this crowded segment.

              The 2024 Astor launch demonstrates MG Motor&apos;s
              customer-centric approach and long-term view of the Indian market.
              While other brands refresh models every 5 years or so, MG has
              updated the Astor in under 2 years of its launch highlighting its
              agility and resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              MG entered India in 2019 with the Hector SUV that took the market
              by storm. The company has since expanded its portfolio to 5 models
              across the mass and premium segments, including the Astor,
              Gloster, ZS EV and MG One budget SUV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the pandemic and global volatility, MG has invested over
              Rs 3,500 crore in India - in manufacturing, R&D and networks. The
              carmaker employs over 2,000 people in India and provides indirect
              employment via its 450+ dealerships.
            </p>
            <p>
              By regularly injecting newness into products, MG is giving tough
              competition to established players. The updated Astor will appeal
              to existing owners through its added tech and value. For new
              buyers, its refreshed proposition makes it a serious contender
              among other options.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 2024 Astor reiterates MG&apos;s dynamic approach and
              commitment to the Indian market. By responding quickly to user
              feedback and evolving needs, the company is building models that
              resonate strongly with customers. The updated Astor has the
              ingredients to boost MG&apos;s sales and market share further in
              2023.
