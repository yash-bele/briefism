          Apple&apos;s recently launched Vision Pro headset is undergoing
          rigorous testing, revealing a surprising level of durability. Sam Kohl
          from AppleTrack, a tech YouTube channel, subjected the futuristic
          wearable to various forms of abuse, including intentional drops,
          collisions with walls, and bumps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vision Pro&apos;s glass demonstrated remarkable resilience to
          everyday wear and tear, surviving intentional impacts against walls
          with only minor scuffs and no shattering. The front panel proved
          exceptionally sturdy, withstanding multiple drops from considerable
          heights. Even with the headset&apos;s weight of 600 to 650 grams, it
          took eight high falls to eventually cause the front glass to splinter.
          Notably, the twin internal and external screens continued to function
          properly despite the damaged cover.

          However, the peripheral speakers faced challenges during the
          durability tests. One speaker ceased to function after several impacts
          against the wall, and the connections to the headband eventually
          broke, leading to a loss of power. The lightweight magnetic light
          seals also tended to detach easily upon impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these issues, the overall durability of the Vision Pro
          impressed, showcasing resilience to reasonable mishaps. It should be
          noted that while the front glass demonstrated strength, repairing a
          damaged screen comes with a significant cost. Without AppleCare, the
          repair is priced at $799, and with the protection plan, it is $299.
          For other damages, Apple quotes up to $2,399, emphasizing the
          importance of handling the headset with care to avoid potential repair
          expenses.

          A groundbreaking study proposes an innovative strategy to address the
          memory issues associated with Alzheimer&apos;s and related dementia,
          diverging from the conventional focus on reducing toxic proteins.
          Published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation by researchers at
          the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the study explores the
          potential of targeting the protein KIBRA, primarily found in the
          kidneys and brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to prevailing research, which aims to diminish toxic proteins
          in the brain, the team, led by senior author Tara Tracy, Assistant
          Professor at Buck, concentrates on reversing the damage caused by
          Alzheimer&apos;s. KIBRA, predominantly located at synapses in the
          human brain, plays a crucial role in memory formation and recall. The
          study reveals that Alzheimer&apos;s brains exhibit a deficiency in
          KIBRA, prompting the researchers to investigate its impact on synaptic
          signaling.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full h-72 sm:h-96 bg-slate-200 rounded-xl overflow-hidden">

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Measuring KIBRA levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the team observed
          an inverse relationship between levels in the fluid and the brain,
          correlating with dementia severity. Surprisingly, a strong correlation
          emerged between increased tau levels—a toxic protein associated with
          Alzheimer&apos;s—and elevated KIBRA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand KIBRA&apos;s influence on synapses, the researchers
          created a functional version of the protein and tested it on lab mice
          with Alzheimer&apos;s-like conditions. The results indicated that
          KIBRA has the potential to reverse the specific memory impairment
          linked to this form of dementia, suggesting its ability to rescue
          mechanisms supporting synaptic resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The findings open the door to the possibility of using KIBRA as a
          treatment to enhance memory, even in the presence of toxic proteins
          responsible for damage in Alzheimer&apos;s. The study marks a
          significant shift in the approach to Alzheimer&apos;s treatment,
          focusing on repairing synaptic function rather than solely reducing
          toxic protein accumulation. The researchers are now working on
          developing a therapy based on these promising results.

          Tech CEOs are scheduled to testify on Wednesday at a Senate Judiciary
          Committee hearing addressing child safety concerns on social media
          platforms. During the hearing, executives from X, TikTok, Discord,
          Meta, and Snap are expected to provide rare commitments to policies
          and endorse regulations, according to representatives from these
          companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          These hearings involving tech CEOs are typically contentious, and this
          one is anticipated to be no different. However, company
          representatives have stated that their CEOs will extend olive branches
          by expressing support for legislative initiatives and providing
          assurances on policy matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wifredo Fernandez, Chief of U.S. and Canadian Public Policy at X,
          informed NBC News that CEO Linda Yaccarino plans to endorse the SHIELD
          Act and other legislation related to child safety. The SHIELD Act,
          proposed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., seeks to criminalize the
          transmission of nonconsensual intimate images and sexualized
          depictions of children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several other child safety bills have been introduced in the Senate,
          including the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which aims to establish a
          &quot;duty of care&quot; for social media companies recommending
          content to minors. Additionally, the Stop CSAM Act focuses on
          expanding protections for minor victims and enhancing reporting
          requirements for child abuse, making it easier for victims to request
          content removal from platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Snap has already expressed support for KOSA, aligning it with their
          existing policies. In November, Meta advocated for federal legislation
          requiring parental approval for teens under 16 downloading apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          While tech companies have been slow to support industry regulations,
          the Senate Judiciary Committee sees these hearings as a strategy to
          publicly pressure CEOs into making commitments and pave the way for
          legislation this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linda Yaccarino is not the only CEO making announcements during the
          hearing. Snap&apos;s CEO Evan Spiegel is expected to share that the
          company will not further deploy encryption on Snapchat in ways that
          could impede scanning for child sexual abuse material. Although parts
          of Snapchat are already encrypted, the platform proactively scans
          messages and communications for such content or indications of
          dangerous behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption deployment in apps has sparked controversy, with child
          safety advocates arguing that end-to-end encryption hinders law
          enforcement investigations into potential child predators. On the
          other hand, privacy advocates consider encryption a human right,
          providing protection from surveillance for victims and whistleblowers.

          As humans, our emotional connections aren&apos;t always chosen, and
          the news of NASA&apos;s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter concluding its
          mission feels akin to learning about the passing of a beloved figure.
          While Ingenuity may not have celebrity status, its significant
          contributions to humanity&apos;s space exploration endeavors are
          undeniable. Transported to Mars within the Perseverance Rover, it
          landed on February 18, 2021, and on April 19 of the same year, it
          achieved a historic feat as the first powered controlled flight on a
          celestial body other than Earth.

          Originally designed for a technology demonstration with plans for up
          to five experimental flights over 30 days, Ingenuity surpassed
          expectations. Nearly three years later, it executed a remarkable 72
          flights, covering over 14 times the intended distance and logging two
          hours of flight time. Acting as an aerial scout for the Perseverance
          rover, its remarkable achievements led one to consider
          &quot;Scout&quot; as a fitting alternative name for the helicopter.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, all journeys, whether positive or challenging, must
          eventually conclude. The Ingenuity team planned a brief vertical hop
          on January 18 to assess its location after an emergency landing in a
          previous flight. Telemetry data revealed a successful ascent to 12
          meters, hovering for 4.5 seconds before descending at one meter per
          second. Unfortunately, contact with Perseverance was lost when it was
          about a meter above the surface. While communication was restored the
          following day, images showed damage to one rotor blade during landing,
          rendering Ingenuity incapable of further flight. NASA is investigating
          the communication dropout and the helicopter&apos;s orientation at
          touchdown, but one certainty remains – Ingenuity&apos;s mission on
          Mars has come to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not far from what may be Ingenuity&apos;s final resting place, the
          Perseverance rover persists in its mission. Tasked with exploring
          signs of past and present life on Mars, recent research led by UCLA
          and the University of Oslo, published in Science Advances, confirmed
          the existence of an ancient lake in the Jezero crater, shared by both
          the rover and the helicopter. The study reveals that the crater was
          once filled with water, depositing sediment layers on the floor. The
          subsequent shrinking of the lake and the erosion of sediments formed a
          massive delta. Perseverance&apos;s ground-penetrating radar provided
          data for this discovery, illustrating epochs of environmental changes.
          The rover is actively collecting rock and soil samples, with the hope
          that these specimens may contain traces of life, further fueled by the
          confirmation of lake sediments on the Red Planet.
