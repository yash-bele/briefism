          Realme founder and CEO Sky Li announced on social media that the
          company will soon launch the ‚ÄúNote‚Äù series of smartphones, positioned
          to compete with Xiaomi&apos;s popular Redmi Note lineup. Catering to
          demand for large-screen devices, the Realme Note series aims to
          provide affordable big-screen options for buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Realme currently offers the budget C series, mid-range numbered series
          and flagship GT series. The upcoming Note lineup is expected to slot
          between the regular number series and premium GT series.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to leaks, the first device Realme Note 1 will sport a
          6.67-inch 120Hz OLED display with FHD+ resolution and in-screen
          fingerprint scanner. It is tipped to be powered by the MediaTek
          Dimensity 7050 chipset. The triple camera setup may include a 108MP
          main camera, 8MP ultrawide lens and 2MP macro camera, plus a 16MP
          selfie camera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Note 1 is said to pack a 5,000mAh battery with 67W fast charging
          support and stereo speakers. Going by the leaked specs versus Infinix
          Note 30 and Redmi Note 13, the Realme Note 1 could be priced
          attractively under Rs 20,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is unclear when the Note 1 will launch and if the lineup will offer
          Pro/Pro+ models like Redmi Note series. Meanwhile, Realme just
          confirmed its 12 Pro series launch in India on January 29th.

        <p>
          With the Note series, Realme aims to capture the market for affordable
          big-screen smartphones, which is currently dominated by Xiaomi&apos;s
          Redmi Note. Realme&apos;s numbered series and GT series don&apos;t
          offer many low-cost large display options currently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaked 6.67-inch screen size reveals Realme plans to compete
          head-on with Redmi Note in the budget big-screen segment. The OLED
          panel and 120Hz refresh rate also give it an edge over LCD displays of
          competing devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Powered by a capable Dimensity 7050 chipset, the Note series will
          offer higher performance than Redmi&apos;s Snapdragon 4 Gen 1-based
          Note 13. The flagship-grade 108MP camera will also provide superior
          photography experience and lend premium appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Priced attractively under Rs 20,000, the Note series solves
          Realme&apos;s gap in affordable large-screen smartphones. It neatly
          slots between the premium GT and regular number series. With a
          value-for-money formula of good specs, big display and low price, it
          can shake up the budget smartphone landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Realme will need to ensure compelling differentiators beyond
          just large screens to stand out against Redmi&apos;s strong brand
          presence and familiar Note series. Smooth software, good battery life
          and appealing design will be key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the Note lineup indicates Realme&apos;s strategy of covering
          all price tiers and consumer needs. Alongside its budget C series,
          performance-centric GT models and all-rounder number series, the Note
          range helps Realme cement its &quot;value flagship&quot; appeal and
          take on rival Xiaomi more strongly across segments.
