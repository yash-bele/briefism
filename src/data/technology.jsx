          Apple is reportedly preparing to reveal ground-breaking generative
          AI-based tools for its coveted iPhone series at the Worldwide
          Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024, which is scheduled for June, in a
          tech race against its rivals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the observations made by Mark Gurman, the tech expert at
          Bloomberg, in his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter (via mysmartprice),
          the upcoming iOS 18 update from Apple is expected to bring in a new
          era of artificial intelligence by introducing a number of cutting-edge
          features that are intended to improve user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anticipated artificial intelligence features might comprise
          auto-summarization, which enables users to condense lengthy content,
          and an auto-complete feature for applications, which streamlines user
          interactions. Additionally, it is rumored that Apple will incorporate
          AI into Apple Music, offering a more customized and user-friendly
          music streaming experience. The report also suggests that new AI-based
          developer tools will be released, giving creators more opportunities
          to innovate inside the Apple ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Gurman, since early 2023, Apple has been working hard to
          develop a proprietary Large Language Model (LLM) called Ajax. This
          cutting-edge model seeks to integrate AI capabilities into
          Apple&quot;s flagship devices, including iPhones and Macs. When it
          comes to incorporating AI into services like Siri, Apple Music,
          essential apps, and more, the LLM will be essential. But it&quot;s
          anticipated that Apple will proceed cautiously and choose to release
          these features gradually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gurman predicts that Apple&quot;s AI vision will be fully realized by
          2025, indicating that the tech giant has a visionary roadmap that goes
          beyond 2024. This ambitious timeline highlights Apple&quot;s
          dedication to the methodical and meticulous integration of new
          technologies, even though it suggests that not all AI-centric
          announcements will materialize in the upcoming year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond advancements in AI, Gurman offers insight into Apple&quot;s
          more comprehensive product plan. The highly anticipated mixed reality
          headset, the Apple Vision Pro, is expected to be released in February.
          It is reported that new iPad Pro models with OLED screens and the
          potent M3 SoC will go on sale in March. There may also be a larger
          12.9-inch iPad Air release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, Gurman claims that a revised Apple TV 4K with a new
          chipset may hit the market in the first half of 2024.
