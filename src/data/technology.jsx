          contribute to investor trust and major investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gupta emphasizes India&apos;s stable policies and leadership as key
          factors contributing to investor trust, highlighting the
          government&apos;s role in policy stability. Discussing the report, he
          underscores the significance of India‚Äôs domestic market in driving
          semiconductor consumption, projecting substantial growth and potential
          for a self-sustaining semiconductor industry that reduces dependency
          on imports, contributing to economic stability.
        </p>

          semiconductor manufacturing, capitalizing on a robust semiconductor
          design ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the report informs government efforts in deepening commercial
          ties between the US and India in the semiconductor sector, it
          acknowledges companies adopting a ‚ÄúChina-plus-one‚Äù or ‚ÄúChina-plus-two‚Äù
          strategy to enhance supply chain resilience. John Neuffer, president
          and CEO of Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), sees this as a
          crucial moment for the semiconductor industry and strategic
          cooperation between the US and India. Despite fierce global
          competition for semiconductor investment, Neuffer acknowledges
          India&apos;s strong value proposition and the potential to expand its
          role in the sector.

          If you&apos;re currently using Google Drive, chances are you&apos;ve
          encountered some challenges when searching for and organizing files,
          particularly on iOS and Android devices. Google Drive offers a
          convenient platform for file storage and access, but its search
          functionality has been less than perfect, especially when you&apos;re
          trying to locate a file without remembering its exact name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing this issue, Google has introduced a significant update for
          iOS users (with Android availability expected soon). This update aims
          to enhance the search experience by introducing filter categories,
          suggesting relevant filters while typing, and providing additional
          refinement options after the search results are displayed.
        </p>

          <span className="block text-xl">Eligibility for the Update:</span>
          This update is currently accessible to Google Workspace users,
          individual subscribers to Google Workspace, and individuals with
          personal Google accounts. It&apos;s essential to note that the update
          is applicable when using the Google Drive app on an iOS device, and
          Google has committed to informing users when it becomes available on
          Android devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="block text-xl">How the Update Works:</span>
          In the Google Drive app for iOS, filter categories are conveniently
          located beneath the search bar. These categories include filters for
          File Type, Owners, and Last Modified, streamlining the search process.
        </p>
        <p>
          One notable improvement is the introduction of relevant query filters
          suggested as you type your search query. This feature significantly
          speeds up the search process by allowing you to select filters easily,
          eliminating the need to type out the entire search string.
        </p>
        <p>
          These new features prove invaluable when you&apos;re dealing with
          files that have slipped from your immediate memory on Google Drive.
          For instance, suppose you&apos;re looking for an image but can&apos;t
          recall its file name. With this update, you can simply select the file
          type as an image and specify the range in the Last Modified section,
          making it a breeze to locate the desired file.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, Google&apos;s latest update for the iOS version of the
          Google Drive app represents a significant improvement in the search
          functionality. By introducing filter categories, suggesting relevant
          filters, and offering refinement options, Google aims to streamline
          the user experience, making it more efficient and user-friendly. As
          these improvements become available on Android devices, users across
          both platforms can look forward to an enhanced and more intuitive
          Google Drive search experience.

        </p>
        <p>
          The user-safety report released by WhatsApp provides comprehensive
          details about the complaints received, the corresponding actions taken
          by the platform, and the preventive measures implemented to combat
          abuse on the platform. This transparency is part of WhatsApp&apos;s
          ongoing efforts to ensure user safety and maintain a secure digital
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an effort to empower social media users in India, the Central
          government introduced the Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC). This
          committee is specifically designed to address user concerns related to
          content and other issues on social media platforms. The GAC serves as
          a mechanism for users to appeal decisions made by social media
          platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a company committed to preventing and combating abuse, WhatsApp
          emphasized its position as an industry leader in end-to-end encrypted
          messaging services. Beyond safety features and controls, the platform
          employs a dedicated team comprising engineers, data scientists,
          analysts, researchers, and experts in law enforcement, online safety,
          and technology. This team plays a crucial role in overseeing and
          enhancing efforts to maintain a secure digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proactive approach taken by WhatsApp in banning over 6.7 million
          accounts in January builds upon its commitment to user safety,
          following a similar initiative in December of the previous year when
          more than 69 lakh accounts were banned in India.

          Expressing optimism about India&apos;s potential as an AI-powered
          nation, Gates&apos; visit resonated with the center&apos;s enthusiasm
          for spearheading innovation within Microsoft, spanning AI, cloud
          computing, security, and gaming realms, as articulated by Rajiv Kumar,

          Gates&apos; visit follows Microsoft&apos;s chairman and CEO, Satya
          Nadella&apos;s recent trip to India, where Nadella underscored the
          country&apos;s increasing importance in the realm of AI development
          and deployment. Nadella emphasized India&apos;s exceptional standing
          in terms of developer community size, predicting its eventual
          overtaking of the United States by 2027. This acknowledgment of
          India&apos;s vibrant developer ecosystem aligns with the overarching
          theme of democratizing AI to foster societal transformation.

          The essence of democratizing AI, championed by Gates and echoed by
          Nadella, resonates strongly with IDC&apos;s ongoing endeavors in
          pioneering AI research and development across various domains. While
          Gates has been a vocal proponent of the benefits of AI, he has also
          voiced concerns regarding its potential risks, often elaborating on

          In the contemporary smartphone market, uniformity in design and user
          interface prevails, offering little room for individuality or utility.
          However, HMD Global from Finland aims to disrupt this norm by
          introducing a novel concept termed Fusion, which promises both
          customization and practicality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam Ferguson, HMD&apos;s global head of insight, proposition, and
          product marketing, elucidates the company&apos;s strategy of
          empowering users to personalize their smartphones through the
          selection of diverse &quot;outfits.&quot; These outfits, akin to
          modular components, can be developed by anyone, from developers to
          ordinary consumers, thereby expanding the phone&apos;s functionality
          beyond conventional boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Presented at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Fusion embodies a
          departure from the conventional notion of smartphones. It advocates
          for the integration of hardware and software to address real-world
          challenges, be it a barcode scanner, a medical device, or an extended
          battery. Ferguson emphasizes Fusion&apos;s objective of broadening the
          phone&apos;s utility beyond its existing capabilities, transcending
          mere aesthetic modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of outfits, as opposed to traditional modular
          designations, is facilitated by six pogo pins located on the
          phone&apos;s rear, enabling seamless attachment of accessories. This
          approach democratizes smartphone customization, inviting contributions
          from a diverse array of users, including hobbyists, educators, and
          professionals. Ferguson envisions Fusion as akin to the Raspberry Pi,
          a versatile tool that fosters innovation and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          HMD aims to support users in outfit creation, offering guidance and
          resources to facilitate both hardware and software development.
          Through an intuitive interface and simplified programming process, the
          company seeks to empower individuals and businesses to realize their
          innovative ideas. Additionally, HMD plans to establish a marketplace
          where users can access a wide range of outfits tailored to various
          needs and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first smartphone under the Fusion platform is slated for release
          in July, accompanied by a comprehensive developer toolkit to aid in
          outfit creation. While specifics regarding pricing and specifications
          remain undisclosed, Ferguson assures that outfits will be sold
          separately, ensuring affordability and accessibility for consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          While modular smartphones have been attempted by various companies in
          the past, HMD remains optimistic about Fusion&apos;s prospects. Unlike
          previous endeavors fraught with complexity and technical barriers,
          Fusion boasts a user-friendly approach that simplifies the
          customization process. Ferguson believes that Fusion has the potential
          to redefine the smartphone landscape, offering users unprecedented
          versatility and functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an industry grappling with stagnation, HMD&apos;s Fusion represents
          a refreshing approach to smartphone innovation. By prioritizing user
          empowerment and practical utility, the company aims to rejuvenate
          consumer interest and revitalize the smartphone market. With half of
          its global devices expected to be repairable, HMD emphasizes
          sustainability and longevity in its product offerings, catering to
          evolving consumer preferences.
