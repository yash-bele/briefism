          The Indian Army is launching a major counterterrorism operation called
          Operation Sarvashakti in Jammu and Kashmir in response to
          Pakistan&apos;s attempts to increase terrorist activities in the
          region. The goal is to target terrorists operating on both sides of
          the Pir Panjal mountain range which runs through the Union Territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent times, Pakistan has been supporting and directing terrorist
          groups to try to revive terrorism in the areas south of the Pir Panjal
          range, especially in the Rajouri and Poonch districts. Around 20
          Indian troops have been killed there in attacks by Pakistan-backed
          terrorists, with the most recent attack occurring on December 21 in
          the Dera ki Gali area where 4 soldiers were killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operation Sarvashakti will involve combined counterterrorism
          operations on both sides of the Pir Panjal range by formations of the
          Srinagar-based Chinar Corps and the Nagrota-headquartered White Knight
          Corps carrying out simultaneous operations. The Jammu and Kashmir
          Police, Central Reserve Police Force, Special Operations Group, and
          intelligence agencies will work closely together to foil
          Pakistan&apos;s designs to revive terrorism in the region,
          particularly in Rajouri and Poonch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are intended to be similar to Operation Sarpvinash in
          2003 which targeted terrorists in the same area south of the Pir
          Panjals. The Army Chief General Manoj Pande recently stated that
          terrorist activities had almost vanished there since 2003, but
          Pakistan is now trying to revive terrorism in the region again. He and
          the Northern Army Command held detailed discussions on ways to counter
          this new terrorist threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are being closely monitored by Army Headquarters and
          the Northern Command in Udhampur and were planned soon after Home
          Minister Amit Shah held a high-level security meeting with National
          Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the Army, intelligence agencies, and
          police officials. The Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi
          has also held coordination meetings for joint action against
          terrorists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian Army has started inducting more troops into Rajouri and
          Poonch and strengthening intelligence capabilities. The security
          forces are confident of local support to counter terrorism in the
          area. Even when terrorists provoked troops to fire on civilians at
          Krisna Ghati, the forces showed restraint knowing it could turn the
          population against them. Swift action against own officers and men
          involved in civilian deaths post the December 21 encounter has also
          helped maintain local goodwill.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operations are intended to deny any space for terrorism to revive
          in the region. In the last two decades, determined counterterrorism
          efforts have ensured a marked reduction in violence. However, Pakistan
          has continued to support cross-border terrorism to destabilize Jammu
          and Kashmir. Groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed have
          training camps across the border. Terrorists are regularly sent across
          the Line of Control under cover fire from Pakistan Army posts. Local
          youth are radicalized and recruited too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The increase in infiltration attempts over the last year, arms and
          ammunition drops by drones, and recruitments indicate Pakistan&apos;s
          desperation to stoke terrorism especially after the removal of Jammu
          and Kashmir&apos;s special status. Islamabad wants to portray that the
          situation is not normalizing even three years after Article 370 was
          nullified. Also, fomenting trouble in border areas pins down Indian
          forces. With India-Pakistan tensions at a high after recent terrorist
          incidents, Pakistan would want to keep the border hot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its efforts to revive terrorism south of Pir Panjals poses a double
          threat as it provides entry into both Jammu and Kashmir regions.
          Rajouri and Poonch are very close to the strategic Jammu-Srinagar
          National Highway that is the lifeline of the Kashmir valley. Any major
          attack here can have psychological and economic impact far beyond the
          local populace and suits Pakistan&apos;s disruptive agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why the Indian Army is launching coordinated counterterrorism
          operations across the Pir Panjals before terrorism takes root again.
          The aim is to completely eliminate terrorist presence in these areas.
          In 2003 too, relentless operations had broken the back of terrorism
          here. Though eliminating every terrorist is difficult given the
          terrain and porous border, the intent is to inflict unacceptable
          losses through unrelenting pressure. The counter-infiltration grid
          along the Line of Control is also being strengthened to prevent entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the operations to succeed, gaining the confidence of the local
          population is vital. Sympathetic locals provide information, logistics
          and recruits to sustain terrorism. Alienating civilians can undermine
          even the best-planned operations. The Indian Army has reached out to
          the people through meetings, campaigns and civic action programs.
          Steps have been taken to minimize inconvenience and safeguard human
          rights during operations. Conduct of units is being closely monitored
          to avoid collateral damage. Any excesses are promptly investigated and
          punished as seen in the recent action against erring personnel. These
          measures are helping foster goodwill and support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operation Sarvashakti has commenced in early 2022 at a time when heavy
          snow limits infiltrations. Come summer, as passes open, more
          terrorists will try to infiltrate. The Indian Army aims to use this
          winter to hit terror groups hard before the summer infiltration
          season. With meticulous preparation, transparency, sensitivity and
          determined execution, these operations can deal a decisive blow. The
          Indian Army remains steadfast in its commitment to break the back of
          Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and usher in an era of peace and
          stability for the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <p>
          President Joe Biden revealed that the United States had privately
          conveyed a message to Iran regarding the Iran-backed Houthi rebels
          carrying out attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea.
          &quot;We delivered it privately and we&apos;re confident we&apos;re
          well-prepared,&quot; Biden told reporters at the White House before
          leaving for Camp David for the weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disclosure comes after the Houthi movement threatened a
          &quot;strong and effective response&quot; following an overnight U.S.
          military strike in Yemen, further increasing tensions as Washington
          vows to protect shipping from assaults by the Iran-aligned group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest U.S. strike, which the Pentagon said targeted Houthi radar
          facilities, occurred a day after dozens of American and British
          strikes on other Houthi sites in Yemen. According to White House
          spokesperson John Kirby, the initial strikes degraded the
          Houthis&apos; capability to store, launch and guide missiles or drones
          which they have frequently used to threaten shipping lanes. Kirby
          emphasized that Washington had no interest in waging war in Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked by journalists whether he now felt the term
          &quot;terrorist&quot; was applicable to the Houthi rebels, Biden
          replied &quot;I think they are.&quot; This comes after the Biden
          administration controversially revoked the State Department&apos;s
          designation of the Houthis as a &quot;foreign terrorist
          organization&quot; in 2021, part of a policy shift aiming to ease
          humanitarian crisis in Yemen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. message to Iran highlights Washington&apos;s belief that
          Tehran bears responsibility for the Houthis&apos; aggressive actions
          as their chief international sponsor and arms supplier. While both
          Iran and the Houthis deny any formal relationship, UN experts have
          found extensive evidence of Iranian weapons transfers and other
          support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proxy groups like the Houthis give Iran strategic leverage in the
          region while allowing it to maintain deniability for their actions.
          U.S. officials hope conveying their awareness of Iranian ties may
          induce Tehran to reign in the Houthis before the situation escalates
          further.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, experts warn the private U.S. message is unlikely to persuade
          Iran to pull back support and curb Houthi attacks on shipping in the
          Red Sea, a crucial commercial waterway. The Houthis have become
          increasingly brazen, using drones and missiles to target vessels
          sailing to and from the Suez Canal. Millions of barrels of oil pass
          through the area daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Houthis say they are retaliating for coalition airstrikes
          and a sea blockade, their attacks are seen as part of a broader
          Iranian strategy to project power and demonstrate the vulnerability of
          global energy supply chains. Disrupting shipping could also drive up
          oil prices which benefits Tehran.
        </p>
        <p>
          The U.S. is coordinating closely with Gulf allies like Saudi Arabia
          and the UAE who are battling the Houthis in Yemen. But American
          officials are wary of being dragged into Yemen&apos;s complex civil
          war. The limited strikes specifically targeted Houthi capabilities to
          threaten shipping and avoid civilian areas. But analysts caution that
          direct U.S. intervention could empower the Houthis and aid their
          recruitment.
        </p>
        <p>
          With no clear military solution in Yemen, experts argue the only way
          forward is a negotiated settlement between the Houthis and
          Saudi-backed Yemeni government. But meaningful talks have stalled
          despite international efforts. The Houthis may prefer to keep fighting
          amid perceived battlefield gains while the Saudis remain skeptical of
          their intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, the uptick in Houthi attacks has turned the Red Sea
          into an arena for shadowy attacks and counterstrikes. The U.S. message
          to Iran reflects the seriousness with which it views the threat to
          international shipping. While seeking to avoid further escalation,
          Washington also wants to signal its resolve to protect freedom of
          navigation and safeguard a vital global trade artery.

          Amid rising unemployment and a housing crisis in Canada, Immigration
          Minister Marc Miller announced that in the coming months he will
          examine capping the number of international students residing in the
          country. Miller did not specify the extent of the reduction being
          considered in the immigration system.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview with Vassy Kapelos on CTV&apos;s Question Period,
          Miller stated a federal-provincial discussion is needed &quot;to
          ensure provinces not doing their jobs actually rein in student numbers
          purely on a volume basis.&quot; He said the volume of international
          students in Canada is &quot;disconcerting&quot; and the system has
          &quot;gotten out of control.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller plans to explore setting a cap on international students in the
          first half of 2023 to help ease housing demand. When asked why the
          government is only now considering a cap despite the idea being raised
          months ago, he said federal level data is needed first before
          examining each province&apos;s institutions that may be profiting from
          high enrollment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It&apos;s time to have a conversation about volumes and the
          impact that is having in certain areas,&quot; Miller added. A student
          cap would not be a one-size-fits-all solution for housing shortages
          nationwide, he noted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller also said housing is only one factor in immigration targets.
          The pressing need to lower the workforce&apos;s average age must also
          be considered. While not providing specifics, he said reducing student
          numbers through a cap is under consideration and will remain so. Out
          of courtesy to the provinces, these discussions will occur at the
          negotiating table first, Miller stated, also factoring in
          institutions&apos; financial needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government has faced criticism for accepting rising immigrants,
          both permanent and temporary, amid a housing crisis. Internal
          documents show public servants warned two years ago that high
          immigration goals could threaten affordability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Liberals aim to welcome 485,000 immigrants this year, and 500,000
          in 2025 and 2026. Hundreds of thousands of temporary residents like
          international students and migrant workers also arrive annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          A student cap would aim to curb demand, but risks detrimental impacts
          on institutions reliant on their tuition. Canada is a top global study
          destination and international students provide economic benefits. A
          balanced approach is needed to manage volumes without disrupting
          education and migration systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provinces like Ontario which attract nearly 40% of Canada&apos;s
          international students could be disproportionately affected by a
          blanket cap. A tailored province-wise approach may be more prudent.
          Students also create jobs and growth, so local labor market needs must
          be analyzed before reducing numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capping student visas also does not address the root cause of housing
          unaffordability - insufficient supply. A cap could even worsen
          shortages if students continue arriving while fewer homes get built.
          Alongside any immigration changes, experts stress boosting housing
          supply by updating zoning laws and slashing red tape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stakeholder views are important too before enacting a cap.
          Institutions warn blunt cuts could cripple revenue and impact
          learning. Students fear upending their future plans. A nuanced
          solution like needs-based entry could be explored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatives like rent controls, vacant home taxes and boosting
          on-campus housing should be considered as well. A student cap risks
          damaging Canada’s reputation as a welcoming study destination.
          Partnerships with universities to align enrollment and housing
          capacity better could be fruitful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, a balanced approach is required that stabilizes
          immigration at sustainable levels while rapidly expanding housing
          supply, especially affordable units. Canada’s future growth and
          competitiveness hinges on getting this policy mix right. A student cap
          may be one temporary tool, but broader structural solutions around
          housing and immigration are imperative for lasting impact.

          His statement was in response to Owaisi&apos;s remark insinuating
          Ramdev&apos;s non-Brahmin origins. Ramdev maintains he was simply
          clarifying his lineage and the context was misconstrued. He insists he
          has always spoken against caste discrimination and worked to uplift
          backward communities through his initiatives. The yoga guru hopes this
          controversy does not overshadow his lifelong efforts to promote
          equality.

          Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy recently revealed in a CNBC-TV18
          interview that he had once applied for a job at Wipro but was
          rejected, leading to the genesis of Infosys, one of Wipro&apos;s
          fiercest competitors in the IT industry. Wipro&apos;s former chairman
          Azim Premji later admitted to Murthy that not hiring him was a
          mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Azim once told me that one of the biggest mistakes he made was
          not hiring me,&quot; the 77-year-old Murthy said. He added that if
          Premji had hired him, things may have transpired differently for both
          him and Wipro.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1981, Murthy founded Infosys along with six friends and 10,000
          rupees of seed capital provided by his wife and author Sudha Murty.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Murthy built Infosys from the ground up, Premji transformed his
          family&apos;s vegetable oil business into a global IT solutions
          provider. As of January 2024, Infosys is valued at 6.65 lakh crore
          rupees while Wipro stands at 2.43 lakh crore, exemplifying the
          divergent fortunes of the two IT titans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy&apos;s entrepreneurial journey began with a research job at IIM
          Ahmedabad followed by a stint as chief systems programmer developing
          India&apos;s first BASIC interpreter for an early computer. After a
          failed prior tech venture called Softronics, the seeds of Infosys were
          sown.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy&apos;s perspective on family businesses differs markedly from
          Premji&apos;s approach. While Premji&apos;s son Rishad took over the
          reins at Wipro in 2019, Murthy asserts his son Rohan would never ask
          to be part of Infosys. &quot;I think he&apos;s even stricter than me
          on these ideas; he will never say that,&quot; Murthy stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decades ago, Murthy similarly rejected his wife Sudha Murty&apos;s
          wish to join Infosys, a decision he now regrets. Murthy admitted he
          was wrongly idealistic in not supporting Sudha, an engineer he says
          was more qualified than Infosys&apos; founders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Murthy has espoused keeping family and business separate, wanting
          Infosys to be a meritocratic workplace not influenced by nepotism. He
          credits Infosys&apos; success to its world-class governance and
          management entirely unrelated to the founders&apos; families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Infosys&apos; credo of empowering professionals on merit dissuaded
          Murthy&apos;s children from seeing Infosys as their entitlement.
          Murthy takes pride that his daughter is a schoolteacher and son is an
          academic uninterested in Infosys. He believes family businesses often
          struggle when incompetent heirs ascend due to privilege rather than
          capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Premji&apos;s grooming of Rishad since 2007 to lead Wipro evokes the
          old-world family business model where bloodline trumps merit.
          Murthy&apos;s point is underscored by the middling performance of many
          Indian family conglomerates. Infosys&apos; rise as a global success
          story built on transparent governance and talent shows an alternative
          path.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Premji&apos;s well-planned generational transition has so far
          been smooth. Rishad&apos;s track record includes leading Wipro&apos;s
          strategy and M&A for years before assuming the CEO role. Good
          succession planning has allowed the $11 billion company to continue
          its growth trajectory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts say neither approach is necessarily right or wrong. Premji has
          ensured continuity and stability by elevating his son. Murthy has
          upheld fairness and achievement by excluding his children. There are
          merits and demerits to both philosophies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, what matters is identifying and empowering the right
          leaders to take an organization forward. Wipro and Infosys exemplify
          how different leadership models can thrive. Their unique approaches
          shaped by the personal values of their pioneering founders offer
          important lessons for Indian business.
