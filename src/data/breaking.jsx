          Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, representing the Hindu party in the
          Gyanvapi dispute, highlighted the Archaeological Survey of
          India&apos;s acknowledgment that a significant Hindu temple existed
          before the current structure was erected.
        </p>
        <p>
          On May 16, 2022, a commission appointed by a local court concluded a
          videographic survey of the Kashi Vishwanath temple-Gyanvapi mosque.
          During the survey, a structure, contested as a &quot;shivling&quot; by
          the Hindu side and a &quot;fountain&quot; by the Muslim side, was
          discovered within the mosque premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          By July 21, 2023, the Varanasi district court ordered a scientific
          survey of the Gyanvapi mosque complex to determine whether it was
          &quot;constructed over a pre-existing structure of a Hindu
          temple.&quot; District and Sessions Judge A K Vishvesha directed the
          Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct a thorough
          investigation at the property in question, which is settlement plot
          number 9130 (Gyanvapi mosque).
        </p>
        <p>
          The ASI&apos;s survey, initially halted by legal challenges from the
          Anjuman Intezamia Masajid Committee for Gyanvapi mosque and the UP
          Sunni Central Waqf Board, resumed on August 4, 2023. The Allahabad
          High Court and the Supreme Court had dismissed pleas against the
          survey. Since then, the ASI teams have been diligently examining the
          campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 11, 2023, the Varanasi district court granted an
          additional week to the ASI to present the findings of the
          court-mandated scientific survey of the Gyanvapi mosque premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest development occurred on January 25, 2024, when the ASI
          submitted its report to both the Hindu and Muslim parties involved in
          the dispute.

          Despite the Mumbai Police issuing a notice denying permission for a
          hunger strike in the city, Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil
          has declared his intent to proceed with the demonstration at Azad
          Maidan on January 26. As thousands of Maratha protesters join him on
          their way to Vashi Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC),
          Jarange-Patil faced delays due to a massive crowd at his roadshow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scheduled to begin his hunger strike with supporters at Azad Maidan,
          Jarange-Patil and his followers are advocating for Kunbi (OBC) status
          for the Maratha community. In response, the Mumbai Police issued a
          notice under Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code, expressing
          concerns about the potential disruption to Mumbai&apos;s financial
          operations and transportation system if the protesters entered the
          city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police suggested an alternative gathering site at the
          International Corporation Park Ground in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai,
          emphasizing compliance with court orders. The notice highlighted
          restrictions on the size of protests at Azad Maidan and Shivaji Park
          due to space limitations and ongoing government events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the police notice, Jarange Patil affirmed his commitment to
          Azad Maidan, expressing unawareness of any denial of permission. He
          asserted that the protest aims to secure Kunbi status for Marathas
          without disrupting Republic Day celebrations. The organizers in Mumbai
          announced plans for a flag-hoisting ceremony at Azad Maidan to mark
          Republic Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          While a government delegation attempted to dissuade Jarange-Patil from
          marching to Mumbai, he insisted on the Chief Minister and deputy Chief
          Ministers personally engaging in discussions to resolve the issue.
          Addressing concerns raised by the Navi Mumbai police, Jarange-Patil
          stated that local organizers should address route changes and
          reiterated his determination to proceed as planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the police notice, the Mumbai march organizers, led by
          Virendra Pawar, engaged with officials at Azad Maidan police station,
          expressing discontent with the last-minute notice and reaffirming
          their decision to proceed with the originally planned program.

        <p>
          On January 22, 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conducted the pran
          pratishtha ceremony for the Ram Mandir at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya.
          Guided by revered pandits and Vedic Brahmins, the Prime
          Minister&apos;s ritual marked a momentous occasion for Sanatanis
          worldwide, culminating in the constitutional realization of
          Hindus&apos; right to build a temple for Lord Ram after a painstaking
          500-year wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prolonged wait has been fraught with challenges and shared
          community memories, particularly for Ayodhya&apos;s Suryavanshi
          Kshatriyas, believed to be Lord Ram&apos;s descendants. Raja Gajraj
          Singh, leading the Suryavanshis, fiercely resisted Babur&apos;s army
          during the seizure of Ayodhya, vowing not to wear ceremonial turbans
          until the temple&apos;s restoration. Generations later, they once
          again don turbans as a symbol of reclamation. Other faiths, including
          Sikhism, played a role in reclaiming the temple, as evidenced by Guru
          Nanak Dev&apos;s visit in 1510, a point emphasized in the Supreme
          Court&apos;s 2019 judgment. The prelude to the pran pratishtha
          included the &quot;Akhand Path,&quot; a continuous 48-hour recitation
          of the Guru Granth Sahib.
        </p>
        <p>
          Celebrations echo across India and globally, commemorating the
          500-year wait in diverse ways. From Kutch to Kohima, Kashmir to
          Kanyakumari, and beyond international borders, communities join in
          this historic moment. Unfortunately, some choose not to participate,
          driven by a minority-appeasement mindset. This refusal stems from a
          skewed political prism that fails to recognize the significance of
          Sanatan Dharma in India&apos;s diverse tapestry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Congress Party, historically uncomfortable with India&apos;s
          civilizational heritage, exemplifies this attitude. In 1947, Prime
          Minister Nehru opposed rebuilding the Somnath Temple, reflecting
          disdain for Hinduism. In 2007, the Congress government sought to
          dismantle the Ram Setu, dismissing mythological texts as
          non-historical. This pattern of discomfort with India&apos;s rich
          cultural heritage resurfaced in the run-up to the Ayodhya pran
          pratishtha.
        </p>
        <p>
          The events leading to the Ayodhya ceremony mirror those preceding the
          revival of Somnath post-independence. The Congress party&apos;s
          discomfort with our civilizational heritage, coupled with a misguided
          political calculation, is evident. This warped thinking is an affront
          to the nation&apos;s minorities. The Shah Bano incident in the 1980s
          exemplifies the consequences of such twisted political calculations,
          perpetuating the marginalization of Muslim women&apos;s rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The restoration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya stands as an epochal
          event, reshaping the trajectory of the nation. As Lord Ram returns to
          Ayodhya, India is poised to become a more robust and confident nation,
          dedicated to the well-being and upliftment of all its citizens – a
          true manifestation of the promise of Ram Rajya.

          Independent MLA Dharmendrasinh Vaghela, representing Waghodia in
          Vadodara, submitted his resignation from the state Assembly on
          Thursday. He cited the desire of his constituents to &quot;strengthen
          the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&quot; as the reason for
          stepping down. With this move, Vaghela becomes the fourth MLA to
          resign from the Gujarat Assembly recently, reducing its strength to
          178 from the initially formed Assembly in December 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trio of other resignations includes AAP Visavadar MLA Bhupendra
          Bhayani and Congress MLAs Chirag Patel and C J Chavda from Khambhat
          and Vijapur constituencies, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following his resignation, Vaghela expressed his gratitude to the
          voters who wished to bolster Prime Minister Narendra Modi and
          clarified that he harbors no grievances towards the BJP, signaling his
          imminent return to the party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vaghela, one of three Independent candidates elected in the 15th
          Gujarat Assembly in December 2022, joined fellow Independents
          Dhavalsinh Zala and Mavji Desai in declaring support for the BJP in
          Gujarat. In the 2022 elections, Vaghela contested as an Independent
          after the BJP denied him a ticket and secured victory over BJP’s
          Ashwin Patel by over 14,000 votes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mukul Wasnik, a senior Congress leader, criticized the BJP&apos;s
          approach of acquiring Opposition MLAs, labeling it as detrimental to
          democracy and politics. He expressed concern over the BJP&apos;s
          tactics of pressuring and buying legislators, deeming it damaging to
          democracy. Wasnik emphasized the Congress party&apos;s commitment to
          ideology and vowed to address disgruntled leaders to prevent further
          defections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wasnik&apos;s statements came in the wake of ongoing resignations,
          including three-time Congress MLA CJ Chavda&apos;s recent departure
          from the Assembly, and AAP MLA Bhupendra Bhayani&apos;s resignation
          the previous month. Wasnik, present in Ahmedabad for a meeting of the
          Gujarat Pradesh Election Committee to discuss potential Lok Sabha
          candidates, stressed the need for dialogue with dissatisfied leaders
          to ensure party unity.

          Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron
          engaged in a vibrant roadshow in Jaipur on Thursday, culminating with
          dinner at Rambagh Palace before their journey to New Delhi, where
          Macron assumes the role of chief guest at the Republic Day parade on
          Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Macron, arriving in Jaipur earlier that day, received a replica of the
          Ram Temple in Ayodhya from Modi, who facilitated the transaction using
          UPI and briefed the French President on the process. The leaders also
          made a delightful stop to savor tea in traditional earthen cups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon landing at the airport, Macron was warmly welcomed by External
          Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar, Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajan Lal
          Sharma, and Governor Kalraj Mishra. His itinerary included visits to
          iconic sites like the historic Amber Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage
          Site. En route, thousands of school children and locals lined the
          streets to greet him.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Amber, Macron, accompanied by Jaishankar and Deputy CM Diya Kumari,
          received a grand welcome with a red carpet, adorned elephants, and
          lively Kachhi Ghodi folk dancers. During his visit, Macron interacted
          with students, some fluent in French, and local artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subsequently, Macron proceeded to Jaipur’s Jantar Mantar, where PM
          Modi greeted him with a warm embrace. The leaders explored the
          astronomical observatory established by 18th-century ruler Sawai Jai
          Singh, also designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Modi
          underscored the observatory&apos;s significance, symbolizing the
          convergence of ancient wisdom and modern science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following this, Modi and Macron embarked on a roadshow through parts
          of the old walled city, where they were enthusiastically welcomed by
          large crowds. The city, festively adorned for the occasion, featured
          massive cutouts and hoardings of the leaders, with banners expressing
          a warm &quot;Bienvenue&quot; – French for welcome. The leaders even
          paused for a selfie during the roadshow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modi and Macron made a noteworthy stop at Hawa Mahal and explored
          local shops in the old city. At a shop, Modi purchased a replica of
          the Ram Temple in Ayodhya as a gift for Macron, demonstrating the
          transaction through UPI. The leaders also enjoyed a tea break at the
          renowned Sahu tea stall, opting for traditional earthen cups. Macron,
          in a video, appreciated the uniqueness of the cups, while Modi
          highlighted their environmental friendliness and distinctive earthy
          flavor. Once again, the PM completed the payment through UPI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The roadshow concluded at Sanganeri Gate, followed by a dinner at
          Rambagh Palace in Jaipur before their departure for New Delhi.

          original copy of the Constitution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each exhibit in the collection draws inspiration from the Preamble,
          embodying its commitment &quot;to constitute India into a Sovereign,
          Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic,&quot; incorporating design
          elements like the bull, lotus, elephant, peacock, horse, lion, and
          various geometric and floral motifs.

          corners of India in commemorating the significant milestone of 75
          years since the adoption of the Indian Constitution. They collaborated
          with We The People Abhiyaan as the knowledge partner, presenting the
          Preamble to artisans and elucidating its meanings.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Each piece reflects the inspiration they drew from the words and
          motifs, representing their contribution to the celebration,&quot; said
          Shibani Dasgupta Jai. The exhibition features a nomadic textile
          handwoven in Ladakh, showcasing the warp and weft technique adorned
          with tribal motifs, as well as a traditional textile from the Mishing
          tribes of Assam. The objective is to foster a connection between
          people and these artworks, fostering appreciation for the rich
          textiles and crafts that thrive in India.

          &quot;Hamari Virasat&quot; is available for viewing at Cross Maidan

        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond fleet expansion, 2024 will witness Air India commencing the
          complete interior refurbishment of 40 legacy wide-body aircraft,
          including Boeing 777s and 787s. The overhaul, starting in July, will
          encompass the replacement of seats and in-flight entertainment systems
          on the legacy wide-body fleet, coinciding with the initiation of
          international operations for Air India’s first A350 aircraft. This
          aircraft, having recently commenced commercial operations, will
          initially operate on domestic sectors for a few months for crew
          familiarization flights. Additionally, interior upgrades for 41
          narrow-body A320 aircraft are also planned for this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Campbell Wilson emphasized the progress made in the past two years
          since privatization, acknowledging the need to further upgrade the
          legacy fleet, enhance consistency, address remaining gaps, and fortify
          fragile processes. He expressed optimism about the visible and
          tangible future, encouraging the airline to rise to meet the high
          expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last two years, Air India has expanded its legacy fleet with
          36 leased aircraft and placed a substantial order for 470 aircraft
          with Airbus and Boeing. The airline has introduced five domestic and
          11 international routes, inaugurated five new international stations,
          and launched new brand identities for both Air India and Air India
          Express.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since returning to the Tata group on January 27, 2022, Air India has
          focused on enhancing its product offerings and planning extensive
          expansions. The Vihaan.AI five-year roadmap was designed to
          substantially grow the airline’s network and fleet, aiming for
          sustained growth, profitability, and market leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to data shared by Wilson, Air India achieved a remarkable
          249% revenue growth over the past two years, while Air India Express
          witnessed a 148% revenue growth. Although specifics about the group’s
          financials were not provided, Wilson acknowledged the significant
          progress made in a short time, attributing it to the commitment,
          energy, and hard work of the Air India team.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tata group is in the process of consolidating its airline business
          by merging Air India and Vistara to create a single full-service
          carrier under the Air India brand. Additionally, Air India Express and
          AIX Connect (formerly AirAsia India) are being merged to form a single
          budget airline under the Air India Express brand. While the
          operational integration of Air India Express and AIX Connect is
          complete, the merger of Air India and Vistara is anticipated in 2025.

          In a significant judgment, a Kerala court has handed down a cumulative
          sentence of 150 years to a 42-year-old man convicted of repeatedly
          raping his minor daughter. The heinous crimes took place in the
          man&apos;s residence near Perinthalmanna. The Fast Track Special
          Court-II judge, Sini S R, pronounced the verdict, imposing various
          sentences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses
          (POCSO) Act, IPC, and the Juvenile Justice Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          The convicted individual, who has three wives, including the minor
          victim&apos;s mother, received sentences that add up to 150 years.
          However, since the sentences are to be served concurrently and the
          longest jail term is 40 years, the man will ultimately serve 40 years
          in prison, as clarified by the court order available on the official
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the IPC and POCSO Act, the court sentenced the man to 30 years
          each for the offenses related to rape and penetrative sexual assault
          on a child under sixteen years of age. Additionally, he received 40
          years each for the offenses of penetrative sexual assault on a child
          more than once or repeatedly and penetrative sexual assault on a child
          by a relative through blood, adoption, or marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the man faced a seven-year sentence for the offense of house
          trespass under the IPC and a three-year sentence under the Juvenile
          Justice Act for cruelty to a child.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the imprisonment, the court imposed a total fine of Rs
          four lakh, with Rs two lakh directed to be paid as compensation to the
          victim. The District Legal Services Authority, Manjeri, has been
          recommended to determine the compensation amount under the Victim
          Compensation Scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          The disturbing incident occurred in 2022, as reported by the Kalikavu
          police station, the jurisdiction where the crime took place. According
          to the police, the minor victim is the daughter of one of the three
          wives of the convicted individual, and the assaults occurred when
          there was no one else present at home.

          Thane&apos;s crime branch officials arrested a 42-year-old fisherman,
          Abhay Parshuram Pagdhare, on Wednesday, seizing eight kilograms of
          charas (hashish) valued at Rs 80 lakh. Pagdhare claimed that his
          brother discovered the abandoned drug packet near the sea, believed to
          be part of a major drug consignment dumped by a larger racket in the
          sea. Attempting to capitalize on the opportunity, Pagdhare and his
          brother sought to sell the drugs but were apprehended by the police.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thane Police Commissioner Ashutosh Dumbre confirmed the arrest,
          emphasizing the authorities&apos; strong stance against both drug
          traffickers and consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pagdhare, a resident of Dahanu taluka in Palghar district, was
          apprehended at the &apos;I Love Majiwada&apos; junction in Thane,
          based on reliable information received by Crime Branch Unit-5 Senior
          Inspector Vikas Ghodke. A bag containing 8 kilograms of charas was
          seized from Pagdhare during the arrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          During questioning, Pagdhare disclosed that his brother found the drug
          packet off the coast near Gujarat. His brother handed it over to
          Pagdhare, who attempted to sell it for quick profit, according to a
          crime branch officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seized drugs are believed to be part of a large drug consignment
          discovered abandoned off the Raigad and Ratnagiri beaches last year.
          Initially, over 278 kg of hashish was found on seven different
          Ratnagiri beaches from August 14 to 22. Subsequently, on the Raigad
          coast, 175 packets of hashish, totaling 209.13 kg and worth ₹8.36
          crore, were found on five beaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Some fishermen had discovered the drug packets, and they all
          returned them to the police. However, a few did not. Later, some of
          them were arrested as well. We suspect Pagdhare and his brother could
          be from that group. We are investigating Pagdhare&apos;s
          brother&apos;s involvement,&quot; said another police officer.

          Uttar Pradesh Police&apos;s Director General of Law and Order,
          Prashant Kumar, and Deputy Inspector General of Police, Manzil Saini,
          are set to be honored with the President&apos;s Medal for gallantry on
          Republic Day. This recognition stems from their pivotal roles in the
          apprehension of four individuals accused of kidnapping Dr. Shrikant
          Goud, a doctor associated with a prominent hospital in Delhi, back in
          2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident unfolded on July 6, 2017, when Dr. Shrikant Goud was
          abducted, and the captors demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore for his
          release. A collaborative effort between Meerut police and their
          counterparts in Delhi resulted in the successful rescue of Dr. Srikant
          Goud from the kidnappers on July 19, 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of the arrests and the subsequent rescue operation,
          Prashant Kumar held the position of Additional Director General
          (Meerut zone), while Manzil Saini served as the Meerut Senior
          Superintendent of Police. Prashant Kumar, a 1990-batch IPS officer, is
          set to receive his fourth President&apos;s Medal, having been
          previously honored in 2020, 2021, and 2022 with the President&apos;s
          Police Medal for bravery.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to Kumar and Saini, seven other police officers will be
          presented with the President&apos;s Medal for Distinguished Service,
          while 74 officers will be recognized with meritorious service medals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among those receiving the President&apos;s Medal for Distinguished
          Service are five Additional Director General-rank officers: Sujeet
          Pandey, Dr. KS Pratap Kumar, Piyush Mordia, and Bhagwan Swaroop
          Srivastava.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, meritorious service medals will be bestowed upon 74
          police personnel, including two Inspector General-rank officers:
          Akhilesh Kumar Meena and Deepak Kumar.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these prestigious awards, 744 other police personnel
          will be recognized by the UP Director General of Police for their
          outstanding contributions and distinguished services.
