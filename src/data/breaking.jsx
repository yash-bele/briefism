          In Karnataka&apos;s Haveri district, two men affiliated with a group
          accused of assaulting a Muslim woman and a Hindu man on January 8 are
          facing fresh charges in an assault case involving a 19-year-old woman
          in the same area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 19-year-old Muslim woman experienced an assault by these men,
          accompanied by three others, in the first week of January. The
          incident came to light after police discovered videos of the attack.
          In the January 8 incident at a hotel in Hanagal, the accused recorded
          a video of their assault on the interfaith couple, circulating it on
          social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yallappa Hiraganavar, an officer from the Hanagal police station,
          filed a complaint against Aftab Maqbool Ahmed, a 24-year-old mechanic,
          and Mardansab Mohammed Isaq Mandakki, a 23-year-old merchant, along
          with three others—Mehaboob Ali Gaffarsab Savikeri, Sahib Channapur,
          and Tanveer Gouda, all residents of Hanagal—for attacking the
          19-year-old woman. Ahmed and Mandakki are already in police custody
          over the January 8 attack and the alleged gangrape of a 26-year-old
          married Muslim woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a new police complaint registered on January 14 at the
          Hanagal police station, the 19-year-old woman was allegedly abducted
          by the gang on January 4 between 12 noon and 3 pm after she got off a
          bus. The gang purportedly outraged the modesty of the young woman and
          threatened her with dire consequences if she spoke out about the
          attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the complaint, the gang is said to have interrogated her about a
          man she was traveling with on the bus and whether she had willingly
          gone with him. They recorded a video of the moral policing incident
          and shared it on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, between January 10 and 14, Haveri police arrested seven men
          in connection with the January 8 assault case. Anshu Kumar,
          Superintendent of Police, Haveri, confirmed these arrests during a
          press briefing on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial FIR in the case was filed on January 10 by the Hanagal
          police, prompted by a room boy at the Idigas Lodge. The interfaith
          couple had refrained from filing a complaint due to fears of
          repercussions from their spouses.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, during a court appearance, the woman stated that she was also
          raped by the gang, who took her away after storming into their hotel
          room. The police subsequently invoked charges of gang rape against the
          accused based on the woman’s allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the seven men arrested for the January 8 incident is an
          autorickshaw driver named Abdul Khadar Jaffarsab, 28, who reportedly
          served as an informant to the gang about the interfaith couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police are investigating if some of the accused are involved in
          additional attacks on women under the guise of moral policing in the
          region. The accused have allegedly recorded videos of their assaults
          and shared them on social media, prompting the police to suspect that
          they may have been engaged in such crimes in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          These moral policing incidents, typically associated with right-wing
          groups in coastal Karnataka, have taken a political turn in Haveri.
          BJP leaders have criticized the ruling Congress government, with
          former chief minister and senior BJP leader Basavaraj Bommai, who
          hails from Haveri, alleging double standards in the state
          government&apos;s approach to tackling moral policing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bommai has demanded the creation of a Special Investigation Team to
          look into these cases and has accused the police of attempting to
          downplay the case by taking down a statement that did not include
          gangrape allegations. The situation raises concerns about the
          prevalence of moral policing, the safety of individuals in the region,
          and the effectiveness of the current legal system in ensuring justice
          for survivors. The involvement of political figures and potential
          manipulation of the legal process further underscore the need for a
          comprehensive examination of the root causes and factors contributing
          to such crimes.

          promoting enmity between religious groups. This is in relation to his

        <p>
          Police in Karnataka&apos;s Uttara Kannada district have registered a
          case against BJP Member of Parliament Anantkumar Hegde pertaining to
          promoting enmity between religious groups. This is in relation to his
          controversial remarks made in Kumta during a speech on January 13th
          about the Ram Mandir consecration event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suo motu case against the MP was filed by a police sub-inspector
          attached to the Kumta police station. The complaint alleges Hegde was
          recorded on video making provocative statements against other
          religious groups in a speech to BJP workers and supporters on January
          13th.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his address, the far-right MP called for demolishing several
          mosques in Karnataka, similar to Babri Masjid, claiming they were
          constructed over Hindu temples. The BJP had distanced itself from
          Hegde&apos;s comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Some people can take it as a threat also. We will definitely do
          it. This is a decision of the Hindu community, not of Anantkumar
          Hegde,&quot; he stated at the Kumta meeting on Saturday. &quot;...in
          every village of the state there are small religious places which were
          violated. Until they are demolished, the Hindu community will not sit
          idle....,&quot; he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Revenge, revenge, revenge. If we do not take revenge for 1,000
          years, then the Hindu community can clearly say that this is not Hindu
          blood. We are not a community which will be in debt. We will clear the
          debt at any cost,&quot; Hegde emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police complaint registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections
          153, 153A and 505 quotes Hegde&apos;s statements verbatim for making
          inflammatory remarks and fomenting enmity between groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          A five-time BJP MP, Anantkumar Hegde is a prospective BJP Lok Sabha
          candidate from Uttara Kannada for the upcoming elections. He had been
          inactive in public life the past couple of years owing to illness. In
          the past few weeks, Hegde resumed meeting people to secure candidature
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the first time Hegde has stirred controversy with his
          hardline remarks. In 2017, as a Union Minister, he sparked outrage by
          terming secularists as &quot;people without parentage&quot;.
          Previously in 2016, he had equated Islam with terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest case underscores tensions between Hindu nationalist
          politicians and minority groups in Karnataka. It evokes memories of
          the contentious Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 by Hindu nationalist
          mobs who claimed the 16th century mosque was built over a temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          By calling for similar demolitions, Hegde&apos;s rhetoric threatens to
          inflame communal tensions in the state along religious lines. It also
          contradicts the BJP&apos;s official stance of distancing itself from
          his comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Hegde retains significant support among hardcore Hindu
          nationalists and right-wing voters. Despite past controversies, he was
          appointed a central minister and may be renominated for the Lok Sabha
          polls. This highlights the sway of extremist politicians within the
          party.
        </p>
        <p>
          But such figures also damage the BJP&apos;s image among moderate
          voters and minorities. With Karnataka being a communally sensitive
          state, Hegde&apos;s fiery rhetoric has the potential to stir social
          disharmony during election season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police case indicates authorities are taking his remarks seriously
          given their provocative nature. But it remains to be seen whether
          Hegde will face any meaningful censure from within his party or
          criminal charges for his latest outburst.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fate will be an important test of how far the BJP is willing to go
          to contain fringe extremist voices while still harnessing their
          support during elections. It will also determine whether the party
          prizes broader social harmony over consolidating a hardline
          majoritarian voter base.

          preemptive measure considering the ongoing cold wave conditions and
          foggy weather, school timings have been modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a directive issued by the Education Department on Sunday,
          no schools will commence sessions before 9 AM or continue beyond 5 PM
          until further notice. This adjusted schedule applies to all students
          in government, government-aided, and recognized private schools,
          including those in nursery, kindergarten, and primary sections. The
          order stated that the standard reporting time remains unchanged for
          all teaching and non-teaching faculty.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With the aim of exercising caution given the current foggy
          circumstances, no school (including those with double shifts) will
          begin before 9 AM or have classes after 5 PM until additional
          guidelines are provided,&quot; the order outlined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, on January 7th, Delhi&apos;s Education Minister Atishi
          announced that the winter break would be prolonged until January 12th
          for students from nursery to 5th standard, in light of the severe cold
          wave conditions in the national capital. &quot;Schools in Delhi will
          stay closed for the next 5 days owing to the ongoing cold weather, for
          students from nursery to class 5,&quot; Atishi had tweeted at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Delhi recorded its lowest temperature this winter season so
          far, with the mercury plummeting to 3.5 degrees Celsius. The cold
          intensified further in the Lodhi Road area, where the minimum
          temperature fell to 3.4 degrees Celsius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most parts of Delhi-NCR were enveloped in dense fog, bringing

          The ongoing tensions in the Red Sea resulting from repeated assaults
          on commercial vessels by Yemen’s Houthi rebels are negatively
          impacting the global supply chain. This could lead to a $10-20
          increase in oil prices for major oil importing countries such as
          India, according to World Economic Forum (WEF) President Borge Brende.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an exclusive interview with India Today TV/Business Today and News
          Director Rahul Kanwal, Brende stated that closing the Suez Canal would
          be detrimental for the global supply chain. He expressed hope that the
          Houthi attacks in the region would cease soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brende made these remarks just as the 54th annual World Economic Forum
          meeting is set to commence in the scenic city of Davos, Switzerland.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the interview, Brende highlighted that trade growth fell to
          0.8% last year compared to 3.4%. However, he remained optimistic that
          global trade will “pick up a bit” this year, despite the Red Sea
          crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;However, it doesn’t take much to also have a negative impact on
          this if we close the Red Sea. Even closing the Suez Canal for weeks
          will have a very negative impact on the global supply chain. So, a lot
          is at stake. We also know that this has an impact on oil prices and
          for major oil-importing countries like India, where a $10-20 increase
          in oil prices will have very negative effects on the economy,&quot; he
          explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;So, I hope that this will not escalate further and that shipping
          can resume as usual in the Red Sea in a few days,&quot; he added.

            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;India has been at the forefront due to the digital economy
              and the export of services. This is a very sweet spot for India.
              But, of course, reforms should continue in India. Reforms related
              to education, funding and reforms to tackle unnecessary red tape
              should continue. I feel there is an understanding of all these
              things in New Delhi,&quot; Brende remarked.

              are here will conduct, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
              Governor is here too. I was told by my team that it was
              oversubscribed after half an hour. So, there&apos;s a long waiting
              list,&quot; he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;I think we can only fit 100 of them in the room. They are
              still waiting and they can&apos;t get in and they are upset. So, I

              Discussing global economic growth, Brende stated that the WEF
              projected 2.9% growth this year but was hopeful it could surpass
              3% soon. &quot;We should also acknowledge that many economists
              expected a recession in the US, the largest economy constituting
              25% of global GDP. But there is no recession. It&apos;s probably a
              soft landing. We&apos;re seeing inflation abating a bit. Interest
              rates will then go down,&quot; he explained.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;For India, I think if trade grows again and India gets a
              little more tailwind from the global economy in 2025, I think, as
              I said earlier, India could be a $10 trillion economy in the
              medium to long term, provided reforms continue,&quot; he added.

            <p>
              According to Brende, the upcoming elections in India, the US, the

              Elaborating on the WEF 2024 theme of rebuilding trust in a
              fractured world, Brende emphasized the need for global
              collaboration due to a “clear trust deficit”.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;There is also huge geopolitical competition. But even in a
              fractured, fragmented world, we need to collaborate. Some of the
              most pressing challenges are global – future pandemics, climate
              change, cyber attacks. We also know, for example, from the war in
              Gaza that we need to collaborate now, so this doesn’t escalate
              further,&quot; he stated.

          A video circulating online depicts an IndiGo passenger punching the
          captain while he was making an announcement regarding flight delays.
        </p>

          The widely shared footage has provoked numerous reactions from social
          media users calling for action against the passenger. However, some
          pointed to the frustration among travelers given IndiGo&apos;s pileup
          of complaints over cancellations, unreasonable delays, and subpar
          service standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video shows the captain making a statement about delays. Suddenly,
          a passenger wearing a yellow hoodie rushes up and slaps the captain
          across the face. A flight attendant standing next to the captain
          immediately intervenes, shielding the captain and trying to defuse the
          situation. The attacker is then pulled back by another man in a sky
          blue hoodie as commotion spreads in the cabin.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Sir, you cannot do this,&quot; the flight attendant is heard
          saying as she protects the captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many passengers can be heard justifying the passenger&apos;s behavior,
          blaming IndiGo for the delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The captain had announced the delays after replacing the previous crew
          owing to Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations following
          several hours of waiting. The viral video stated the flight was
          &quot;13 hours&quot; delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FDTL rules mandate adequate rest periods for pilots and crew to
          reduce fatigue, established by the Directorate General of Civil
          Aviation (DGCA).
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes amid a barrage of complaints against IndiGo on social
          media, with numerous accounts of delays and chaos. On Saturday, actor
          Radhika Apte shared her terrible experience after being confined on an
          aerobridge at Mumbai airport for hours along with fellow travelers.
          She said IndiGo staff were clueless, depriving passengers including
          seniors and infants of food and restroom breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flight operations have been hampered the past few days due to harsh
          winter fog across North and Central India.
