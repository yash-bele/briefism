        <p>
          Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, is poised for an elevation
          within the royal family to a pivotal role in King Charles III’s
          restructured monarchy. According to reports, the mother of three could
          be granted new powers by the King after celebrating her 42nd birthday
          recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mail reported that Kate will mark her birthday privately in
          Windsor with husband Prince William and their children George,
          Charlotte and Louis, before returning to school. But soon, she is
          expected to be promoted as per a source.
        </p>
        <p>
          King Charles is said to be considering appointing Kate as a Royal Lady
          of the Order of the Garter. This is regarded as Britain&apos;s most
          senior chivalric order, with members personally chosen by the monarch.
          Prince William, Camilla, Princess Anne and Prince Edward already
          belong to the Order of the Garter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If inducted, Kate would gain the authority to grant royal warrants,
          similar to Camilla and William. Granting royal warrants allows firms
          to use the Royal Arms in branding and supply the royal household. This
          power was previously held by King Charles as Prince of Wales,
          bequeathed by the late Queen Elizabeth II.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Charles retains the power for now, he may eventually grant it to
          Camilla and William too. But some royal warrant holders believe Kate
          officially endorsing brands would provide a huge boost to British
          industry, driving fashion and lifestyle interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a working member of the royal family, Kate has grown into her roles
          over the years. She has focused on early childhood development,
          promoting sports and outdoor activities. Along with William, Kate has
          also advocated for mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, she played piano publically for the first time during a
          Christmas carol concert. Kate has also emphasized environmental
          awareness and sustainability through her initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per reports, King Charles aims to reduce costs and streamline the
          monarchy to core members carrying out official duties. These include
          Charles and Camilla, William and Kate, Princess Anne and Prince Edward
          and his wife Sophie.
        </p>
        <p>
          The promotion indicates Kate’s ever-important position in the new
          royal order. It reflects the faith Charles has in the Princess to take
          on more responsibility as a senior royal.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 41, Kate is the youngest Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter
          after Queen Mary in the early 1900s. Her induction will make her the
          only woman apart from Camilla in the order. It highlights her
          significance and the prominence of her role alongside William.
        </p>
        <p>
          Charles is expected to undertake the Order of the Garter appointments
          in June 2023. The ceremony takes place annually at St. George’s Chapel
          in Windsor. The order consists of the monarch, prince consort, and 24
          knights chosen personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in 1348 by King Edward III, it recognizes high achievement and
          public service. The knights wear elaborate blue velvet robes and
          plumed hats for ceremonies. New knights take part in an investiture
          and pageantry-filled service presided by the King.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Kate, being granted powers to endorse royal warrants shortly after
          turning 40 reinforces her image as a dependable future queen consort.
          It reflects the royal family&apos;s confidence in her maturity and
          readiness for more responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          From being a commoner to future Queen, Kate has come a long way. Her
          evolution into a senior working royal will only accelerate after this
          promotion. With King Charles intent on a meritocratic monarchy, Kate
          and Prince William will have to continually prove their mettle as the
          new face of the modern royal family.

          Tensions have escalated along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border after
          Pakistan began demanding passports and visas from Afghan truck drivers
          at the key Torkham crossing on Saturday. For years, truckers have been
          able to cross freely without documents. But the new requirements have
          effectively closed the vital trade route.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noor Mohammad Hanif, an official in Afghanistan&apos;s Nangarhar
          province, said Pakistani officials suddenly started asking Afghan
          drivers for passports and visas at Torkham. Since most drivers do not
          possess these documents, traffic has stalled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In retaliation, Afghanistan has also started demanding the same from
          Pakistani truckers, according to a statement from the Nangarhar
          governor&apos;s office. Officials from both sides are holding
          discussions to resolve the impasse, with a decision expected soon, the
          statement added.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Torkham crossing has experienced closures multiple times in recent
          months, including a nine-day shutdown in September due to border
          forces clashing. On Saturday, dozens of trucks carrying perishable
          items like vegetables and fruits remained stuck on both sides, unable
          to cross.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysts see this as part of the lingering tensions between Pakistan
          and Afghanistan&apos;s Taliban government. Pakistan is worried about
          the Pakistani Taliban finding sanctuary and regrouping in Afghanistan
          after the Taliban takeover. It has blamed the group for increased
          militant attacks against Pakistani security forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Afghan Taliban denies allowing Pakistani Taliban fighters
          to use its soil for attacks in Pakistan. Last week, senior Pakistani
          politician Fazlur Rehman visited Kabul, the first high-level visit
          since the Taliban takeover, to ease frictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But mistrust persists, as evident from the Torkham situation. Pakistan
          remains concerned about militant activity across the porous border.
          Demanding documents from previously exempt truckers appears to be an
          attempt to tighten control and track movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The border crisis comes amid Pakistan&apos;s ongoing expulsion of
          hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghans, further straining ties.
          Since August 2022, over half a million Afghans without valid papers
          have been deported. Pakistan has long hosted nearly 1.7 million
          Afghans who fled the Soviet occupation and subsequent conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this latest standoff, trade and commerce between the two
          countries will be severely impacted. Torkham is a vital commercial
          artery and trade route to Central Asia for Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          For landlocked Afghanistan, access to the Arabian seaports through
          Pakistan is crucial for exports and imports. Disruptions at Torkham
          will choke key supplies of food, medicines and essential commodities.
          It may exacerbate Afghanistan&apos;s humanitarian crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the border remains closed to traffic, prices of goods transported
          by road may rise sharply in both nations. Transporters will also
          suffer major losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid greater public hardship, both sides will have to resolve the
          documentation dispute quickly through diplomatic channels. Wider
          engagement is also needed to address the core issues driving
          Pakistan&apos;s security concerns and perceived threat from
          Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restarting stalled talks between Taliban and Pakistani authorities on
          border management may help instil confidence. But for now, the
          unpredictable border situation highlights the delicate ties between
          the uneasy neighbours.

          The extreme overcrowding in Maharashtra&apos;s state prisons has led
          to a rise in skin diseases among inmates. To address this issue, the
          Maharashtra prison department has introduced washing machines in jails
          for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Yerwada Central Prison in Pune has become the first jail in the
          state to provide washing machines for inmates. So far, all jails have
          placed orders for 193 washing machines in total.
        </p>
        <p>
          On an experimental basis, nine washing machines were installed in
          Yerwada Central Prison last Friday. Prison officials said they would
          study the impact of using washing machines and based on the results,
          considering the needs, install up to 325 washing machines in all jails
          in the near future.

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Yerwada Prison has an official capacity of 2,753 inmates (2,536
              males, 226 females). But currently, there are 6,610 inmates -
              6,324 males and 286 females. Of these, 5,572 inmates are under
              judicial custody, 972 are convicts, and 66 are detained under the
              Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prison authorities said jails across the state face similar
              overcrowding. While overcrowding contributes to the rise in skin
              diseases, disinfecting inmates&apos; clothes and bedding through
              proper washing is essential for prevention, officials said.
            </p>
            <p>
              The introduction of washing machines follows the example of New
              Delhi&apos;s Tihar Jail. Maharashtra&apos;s prison department is
              taking a cue from there, said Amitabh Gupta, Additional Director
              General of Police (Prisons).
            </p>
            <p>
              While the exact number of inmates with skin diseases was
              unavailable, Gupta said it was very high, with long queues at the
              doctor for skin treatment.

              In addition to washing machines, Yerwada Prison inaugurated
              biometric touch screen e-kiosks on Friday. Using the e-kiosks,
              inmates can quickly access information on their case status,
              account balance, hearing dates, and more. Inmates can also have
              online meetings with lawyers and family through the e-mulakat
              application.

              Officials said overcrowding increases chances of unrest in jails.
              Last month, a murder occurred inside Yerwada jail. There are about
              1,200 inmates in Yerwada booked under the Maharashtra Control of
              Organised Crime Act. Jail superintendents have been instructed to
              segregate members of rival gangs and those accused of terrorism,
              naxalism, etc. More CCTV cameras are being installed in 14
              prisons. A panic button system is also proposed to alert officials
              about incidents quickly.

              The prison department plans to construct new jails in several

          Pushyamitra Bhargava left his successful legal career to become the
          mayor of Indore in 2022, promising to bring corporate culture to the
          municipal corporation. Recently, he has drawn attention for directing
          all malls and shops in Indore to install replicas of the Ram Temple in
          Ayodhya. He warned of consequences for those who fail to comply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two weeks ago, Bhargava wrote to all shopkeepers and malls,
          instructing them to install the replicas between January 15-22,
          coinciding with the temple&apos;s consecration anniversary.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, he justified the order, stating that if Christmas decor is
          allowed from December 25 to January 2, then Ram Temple replicas should
          also be permitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before entering politics, Bhargava was the youngest additional
          advocate general of the Madhya Pradesh High Court. Born and raised in
          Indore, he has an M.Phil in Law from Devi Ahilya University, a cyber
          law diploma from Mumbai, and a journalism certificate from Allahabad
          University. During college, he was active in the ABVP, the BJP&apos;s
          student wing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhargava began his legal career under senior advocate Piyush Mathur, a
          former MP High Court judge. He rose to become the state&apos;s
          youngest deputy advocate general from 2015-2018. He represented the
          government in high-profile cases, including on medical oxygen supply
          during Covid, direct student union elections, and a web series
          allegedly insulting the army.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, Bhargava organized events supporting the Citizenship
          Amendment Act. He also led a &quot;Lawyers for Modi&quot; campaign for
          the 2019 elections. Additionally, he formed a youth organization
          called Sanghmitra to connect youth with patriotism and national
          service.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 2022 mayoral polls, Bhargava defeated his Congress opponent by
          a huge margin, becoming BJP&apos;s youngest Indore mayor. His Ram
          temple replica order has now sparked controversy.

          Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has received his fourth summons
          from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for questioning in the
          controversial Delhi excise policy case. The central agency has asked
          him to appear before it on January 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Kejriwal is likely to be in Goa from January 18-20 to oversee
          his Aam Aadmi Party&apos;s election preparations there, posing a
          scheduling conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Delhi CM has skipped ED questioning on three previous occasions,
          citing reasons like impending Rajya Sabha elections, Republic Day
          engagements as Chief Minister, and lack of response from the ED to his
          queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his latest communication to the ED Assistant Director, Kejriwal
          highlighted that the Election Commission has scheduled Rajya Sabha
          polls from Delhi on January 19. As national convener of AAP, which has
          fielded candidates, he is preoccupied with the nominations and
          campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, as Delhi CM, Kejriwal wrote he is busy with Republic Day
          event planning and preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the third instance of Kejriwal questioning the rationale
          behind ED&apos;s summons via written response instead of physically
          appearing. He expressed concern that despite comprehensively
          responding and raising legal objections, the ED chose not to provide
          clarification.
        </p>
        <p>
          In previous letters, Kejriwal termed the summons as politically
          motivated and alleged they were issued to harass him. He asked the ED
          to specify if he is being summoned as a witness or suspect and in what
          capacity. But the ED did not respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agency wants to question Kejriwal in connection with alleged
          irregularities in Delhi&apos;s now-scrapped excise policy. It claims
          kickbacks and corruption took place when the policy was formulated and
          implemented during Kejriwal&apos;s tenure.

          The ED and CBI filed FIRs in the matter after Delhi LG Vinai Kumar
          Saxena recommended a probe. He alleged violations of rules and
          procedural lapses in the policy, which purportedly benefited private
          liquor dealers.

          Besides Deputy CM Manish Sisodia who handled the excise portfolio, the
          ED has questioned and arrested other AAP leaders and excise department
          officials. Sisodia has been questioned for over 30 hours so far.

          AAP has denied any wrongdoing and accused the BJP-led central
          government of a political witchhunt. Kejriwal earlier alleged he is
          being deliberately targeted to stop AAP&apos;s growing national
          footprint ahead of elections in various states.

          The ED summons have disrupted governance work, claimed AAP. However,
          the BJP retorted that if Kejriwal has done no wrong, he should not
          fear investigation agencies and cooperate.

          With Kejriwal unlikely to appear on January 18 given his engagements,
          it remains to be seen if the ED will relent or take a strong stand.
          The agency can ask a court to direct Kejriwal to join the probe.

          Some analysts argue ED&apos;s repeated summons are creating an
          impression that it is overzealous about questioning Kejriwal. They
          suggest the agency should discuss the concerns raised in his letters
          before issuing fresh summons.
        </p>

          As AAP aims to make inroads in Gujarat and other states, the timing of
          the probe is being seen as intended to dent its prospects. The tussle
          between the Centre and Delhi government looks set to continue, with
          both sides standing firm on their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kejriwal&apos;s non-appearance may provide more ammunition to BJP to
          allege he has something to hide. However, AAP is also likely to use it
          to claim victimization at the hands of the Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the impasse will end remains uncertain. But the excise case has
          certainly introduced new political drama and tensions between
          Delhi&apos;s ruling party and the central government.
