          The stage is set for the consecration ceremony of the new Ram idol at
          the Ayodhya temple on Monday. Diyas were lit, floral decorations
          adorned the columns and walls, around 8,000 chairs awaited special
          guests, and rituals continued all day Sunday ahead of the &apos;Pran
          Pratishtha&apos; ceremony.

          The festive town welcomed many visitors, with the event starting
          shortly after noon on Monday. Prime Minister Modi will arrive in
          Ayodhya at 10:45 am and be at the temple site by 10:55 am to
          participate in the ceremonies from 12:05 pm to 12:55 pm. He will then
          address a public gathering before visiting the Kuber Tila to offer
          prayers at the renovated Shiva temple and unveil a Jatayu statue.

          A major part of the preparatory rituals that began on January 16th
          concluded on Sunday. The day started with the new 51-inch idol being
          covered with honey during the &apos;Madhvadhivas&apos; ritual. It was
          then bathed with medicated water from 114 urns as part of
          &apos;Snapan&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old idol was also taken around the new temple in a decorated
          palanquin before being brought inside. As the rituals continued into
          Sunday evening, the priests said the eyes of the new idol, which were
          closed on January 16th, will be opened after another purificatory
          bath. It will then be shown a mirror to absorb energies created by the
          rituals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ghee and honey will also be applied to the eyes with a gold stick. The
          old idol will be similarly bathed and both idols placed inside the
          sanctum sanctorum. The preparatory rituals ended with
          &apos;Shayandhivas&apos;, symbolically putting the idol to sleep after
          six days of worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quilts from Jaipur and a carved sheesham bed adorned the idol on
          Sunday night. On Monday morning, priests will arrive by 8:30 am to
          complete the remaining rites. The sacred fire will continue burning
          even after the ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consecration of the new Ram Lalla idol marks the fulfillment of a
          decades-old movement. The festivities reflect the devout fervor
          sweeping Ayodhya as this historic moment arrives after years of
          anticipation. PM Modi&apos;s attendance underscores its importance for
          the nation.

          The Union Law Ministry stated on Sunday that a majority of the over
          20,000 responses received by the high-level committee on &apos;One
          Nation, One Election&apos; were in favor of holding simultaneous
          polls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The committee, chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind, held its
          third meeting on January 22nd. It had invited public suggestions
          through a notice on January 5th, with a deadline of January 15th.
          Feedback was also collected via the committee&apos;s website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of 20,972 total responses, 81% supported the idea of simultaneous
          elections across the country. The committee had also sought inputs
          from 46 political parties, out of which 17 have submitted their
          suggestions so far. The Election Commission of India&apos;s views were
          also recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week, Kovind held consultations with former Chief Election
          Commissioners Sushil Chandra and O.P. Rawat, former Madras High Court
          Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, and former Delhi High Court
          Chief Justice G. Rohini. This was part of engaging with eminent
          jurists, ex-Supreme Court and High Court judges, past Chief Election
          Commissioners, and industry bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ministry stated that the committee will hold its next meeting on
          January 27th. The panel was set up last September by the Law Ministry
          and has held two previous meetings. Its mandate is to examine and
          recommend holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha, state
          assemblies, local bodies and panchayats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The move towards &apos;One Nation, One Election&apos; requires
          consensus among political parties. Critics have raised concerns about
          its feasibility in India&apos;s complex federal structure. But
          advocates argue it will cut election costs and provide policy
          continuity at the Centre and states.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a majority of public responses in favor, the committee has a
          strong endorsement for deliberating further reforms. Its
          recommendations will be crucial to build political and public
          acceptance for simultaneous polls. But implementing One Nation, One
          Election will ultimately need Constitutional amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Law Ministry panel represents the government&apos;s most concrete
          step yet towards this long-pending electoral reform. Its consultative
          approach is welcome. Achieving simultaneous national and state
          elections will be challenging, but may strengthen governance in the
          long run if implemented judiciously.

          Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a key meeting in Raipur on Sunday to
          review the efforts to curb Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in Chhattisgarh.
          The objective is to eliminate the Maoist threat in the state within
          three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In attendance were the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Ministers, the
          Union Home Secretary, Intelligence Bureau Director, CRPF Director
          General, Chhattisgarh Chief Secretary, and the state police chief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah noted that joint efforts by central and state security forces
          have contained Maoist activities to some pockets. But a targeted plan
          is now needed to dismantle the entire support ecosystem of the rebels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Home Minister directed the state police to boost security, conduct
          thorough probes, closely monitor court cases, choke funding channels
          and continue intelligence-based operations. He stressed
          operationalizing all actionable inputs shared through the Multi-Agency
          Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah underlined the need to ensure complete coverage of central and
          state welfare schemes in Maoist-hit districts. He said the Home
          Ministry should allow flexibility in allotting and utilizing funds in
          these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Home Minister emphasized sensitively addressing all legitimate
          grievances of locals regarding entitlements. Following this, the Union
          Home Secretary interacted in detail with district police chiefs and
          administrators of the worst LWE-hit districts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-level meeting reflects the resolve to decisively end
          left-wing extremism in Chhattisgarh. The state has seen some of the
          deadliest Maoist attacks in the past decade despite sustained
          counter-insurgency efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah&apos;s emphasis on choking funding channels is critical as
          extortion remains a big source of income for Maoists. Strengthening
          local governance delivery will be equally important to wean away
          popular support from rebels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chhattisgarh police have the experience and motivation needed for the
          final push against extremists. Central assistance can plug gaps in
          resources and capabilities. But ultimately, the key will lie in
          granular, district-specific plans rooted in local realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much progress has been made, but the last mile will be the toughest.
          Concerted action across multiple fronts in the coming years can help
          fulfill the Home Minister&apos;s vision of making Chhattisgarh
          Maoist-free. It will require political will, administrative
          coordination and security force professionalism.

          The eleven men convicted for the 2002 gang rape of Bilkis Bano and
          murder of her family members turned themselves in to authorities late
          Sunday night at the Godhra jail. This comes after the Supreme Court
          revoked the premature release granted to them by the Gujarat
          government on August 15th last year and ordered them to surrender
          within two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eleven men - Radheshyam Shah, Jaswant Nai, Govind Nai, Kesar
          Vohania, Baka Vohania, Raju Soni, Ramesh Chandana, Shailesh Bhatt,
          Bipin Joshi, Pradip Modhiya, and Mitesh Bhatt - arrived at the jail in
          Godhra from Singwad village in two separate vehicles shortly before
          midnight. Most came in a ten-seater van led by an SUV. The district
          police confirmed they had monitored and escorted the men into the
          jail.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for the surrender, police units were deployed outside
          the jail since Sunday evening. The jail authorities verified that the
          eleven men turned themselves in at 11:45pm on Sunday, just meeting the
          Supreme Court&apos;s stipulated deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes after the Supreme Court dismissed petitions from the men
          earlier last week asking for more time to surrender. They had cited
          reasons like caring for elderly parents, an upcoming wedding, and
          needing to harvest crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          On January 8th, the Supreme Court overturned the Gujarat
          government&apos;s decision to grant remission and release the men.
          They had been sentenced to life in prison for the rape of Bano and
          murder of her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Court
          ruled that the Gujarat government lacked the authority to grant
          remission, which should have been decided by the Maharashtra
          government.
        </p>
        <p>
          The men were originally released on August 15th under Gujarat&apos;s
          1992 remission policy based on a Supreme Court order in May 2022 in a
          petition filed by one of the convicts, Radheshyam Shah. Bano
          challenged the release, leading to the January 8th ruling reversing
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was raped by
          multiple men as she fled riot violence in 2002, which also claimed the
          lives of 14 of her family members including her three-year-old
          daughter. By ordering the men to surrender, the Supreme Court has
          provided a measure of justice to Bano after nearly two decades.

          first-aid booths for devotees. A control room will also be set up in

          Vector control and disease surveillance measures have been implemented

          Blaming &quot;politics of appeasement&quot;, he said that after
          independence, the unanimous renovation of Somnath temple sparked
          discussions about other places of worship. A similar consensus could
          have been reached regarding Ram Janmabhoomi, but politics took a
          different turn with the rise of discrimination and appeasement. So the
          issue remained unresolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successive governments disregarded the wishes and sentiments of Hindus
          on this matter. Instead they tried to thwart initiatives taken by
          society. The legal battle dating back to pre-independence times
          continued. The mass movement demanding liberation of Ram&apos;s
          birthplace began in the 1980s and went on for 30 years, he pointed
          out.

        <p>
          Bhagwat said India&apos;s history is one of constant struggle against
          invaders for the past 1500 years. Attacks by Islamist forces from the
          West brought utter destruction and fractured society. Destroying
          native religious sites was key to demoralizing the nation and
          community. Foreign conquerors razed temples in India repeatedly for
          this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demolishing Ram temple in Ayodhya had the same motive of subjugating
          India by weakening society, he stated. However the strategy did not
          succeed. Faith, commitment and morale of Indians never diminished.
          Resistance continued. Repeated attempts were made to regain the
          birthplace and rebuild the temple, through many wars and sacrifices.
          The Ram Janmabhoomi issue remained etched in Hindu minds, Bhagwat
          emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recalling that Hindus and Muslims jointly fought the British in 1857,
          he said there was a chance for reconciliation by banning cow slaughter
          and freeing Ram&apos;s birthplace. Bahadur Shah Zafar guaranteed a cow
          slaughter ban, uniting society against the British. Though the war
          failed, the temple struggle persisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagwat recounted that Ram&apos;s idol appeared at the site in 1949.
          The temple was unlocked by court order in 1986. The Hindu
          society&apos;s campaigns and efforts went on, culminating in the
          balanced Supreme Court verdict of 2019 after 134 years of legal
          battle. Now, on January 22nd, the installation ceremony will be held,
          he stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temple marks the revival of national pride and modern society
          accepting Ram&apos;s values, he said. Bhagwat urged adopting
          Ram&apos;s virtues - integrity, bravery with forgiveness, sincerity,
          humility, compassion, duty focussed strictness. This will require
          honest hard work from all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the RSS chief hailed the temple while calling for communal
          harmony, saying Ram embodied virtues that all should imbibe. He
          recounted the history of temple struggles and court battles. The
          consecration marks cultural reawakening and upholding values,
          according to him.

          Less than 48 hours before the scheduled consecration on January 22nd,
          an elaborate set of rituals involving the new 51-inch idol of Ram
          Lalla were completed on Saturday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes of the new idol, still covered in cloth, underwent various
          &quot;adhivas&quot; rituals which involved draping the entire frame
          with a variety of flowers brought from across India including Tamil
          Nadu, Maharashtra and Kolkata, according to sources involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          These flowers, estimated at 50 kg, included lotus, rose, jasmine and
          chrysanthemum.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a 3 hour ritual called &quot;snapan&quot;, the inner sanctum was
          also washed with water from 81 &quot;Kalash&quot; or urns sourced from
          various religious sites and rivers across India, including Sitamarhi
          in Bihar and Nepal, regarded as Sita&apos;s birthplace. Some urns
          contained medicated water with cow urine and juices of select fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for Monday, public viewing or &quot;darshan&quot; of
          the old Ram Lalla idol at the makeshift temple was halted. It will be
          moved to the inner sanctum on Sunday evening and its viewing is likely
          to resume from January 23rd along with that of the new idol, stated
          Satyendra Das, priest of Ram Lalla.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rituals on Sunday included &quot;Shakradhivas&quot;,
          &quot;Phaladhivas&quot; and &quot;Pushpadhivas&quot;, offering the
          idol sugar and sweets, fruits and then flowers respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the ritual fire ceremony that began on Friday continued
          into the evening around the mandap, about 100 meters from the temple
          site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, elaborate rituals were completed around the new Ram Lalla
          idol less than 48 hours before its consecration. Public viewing of the
          old idol was stopped in preparation for installing the new idol on
          January 22nd. The rituals involved bathing, as well as offerings of
          flowers, fruits and sweets to the deity.

          The day following the December 21st terrorist attack on an army convoy
          in Poonch, where four soldiers lost their lives, reports have emerged
          of alleged detention and torture of civilians by security personnel.
          As per sources, eight residents of Topa Pir village in Poonch were
          picked up, with three dying subsequently and five being admitted for
          treatment at a government medical facility in Rajouri. An additional
          five civilians from the same village have claimed they endured torture
          and unlawful detention as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incidents occurred despite assurances of justice by high ranking
          officials like Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Army Chief Manoj
          Pande during visits to the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is understood that the Jammu and Kashmir police have requested the
          army to furnish medical documents concerning the five hospitalized men
          - Riaz (25) and his brother Farooq (19), along with Israel (20),
          Jameel (18) and Irfan (18). A senior police officer stated that the
          records are required to produce the victims before a judicial
          magistrate and document their statements, as part of the investigation
          into the deaths. The five men are considered eyewitnesses, as they
          were reportedly detained alongside the deceased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wazir Hussain, father of Riaz and Farooq, revealed that his family
          received Rs 2.5 lakhs in compensation for each son – Rs 1 lakh from
          the civil administration and Rs 1.5 lakhs from the army when they were
          discharged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mehmood Bhat, the former village head of Topa Pir, corroborated that
          he assisted the families in obtaining compensation cheques from the
          authorities. The army spokesperson declined to comment regarding the
          five hospitalized men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ambush of army vehicles occurred between Dehra Ki Gali and Bufliaz
          on the Mughal road. The following morning, eight civilians were
          allegedly detained from Topa Pir in the Bufliaz area of Poonch
          district, along with five more from Thanamandi in Rajouri district.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the eight people from Topa Pir, three – Shabir Ahmed (30), Safeer
          Ahmed (45) and Mohammad Showkat (22) – passed away due to injuries
          purportedly sustained from torture. After pleas from locals that the
          others would die without medical intervention, they were admitted to a
          hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to reports, Israel, one of the five detainees from Topa Pir,
          claimed he received a summons to report to an army post around 11:30
          am on December 22nd. He alleged being stripped and beaten with batons
          and iron rods until losing consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Israel stated that Showkat, Shabir, Safeer and Riaz were already
          detained at the camp, while Farooq, Jameel and Irfan were brought in
          later. “We were dragged outside and revived with water before more
          torture,” he recounted, adding they were finally moved to an army
          facility where he regained consciousness that night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the others, Israel maintained he was given Rs 1 lakh by the
          Poonch District Collector and Rs 1.5 lakhs by the army upon discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wazir Hussain alleged his sons’ skin had darkened from the abuse. He
          said he bought them new clothes and shoes in Surankote since they had
          been stripped prior to the ill-treatment and lacked garments when
          hospitalized. &quot;Their current attire was donated by others,&quot;
          he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 27th, Defense Minister Singh and Army Chief General Pande
          visited Rajouri district and met with the families of the deceased
          civilians. As per the bereaved, the Minister promised justice would be
          served.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, addressing troops, Singh remarked that along with defending the
          nation, they also shoulder the huge responsibility of winning the
          hearts of countrymen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rajnath had additionally interacted with the five detainees from
          Thanamandi at the Government Medical College, Rajouri. Discharged
          between January 2nd and 6th, they were identified as Mohammad Ashraf
          (52), Farooq Ahmed (45), Fazal Hussain (50) and his nephews Mohammad
          Betab (25) and a 15-year-old. Each received Rs 3 lakhs in
          compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The J&K administration announced Rs 20 lakhs in compensation for
          families of the deceased, along with a land parcel and government job
          for one member. The army provided Rs 10 lakhs ex-gratia.

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <p>
          The Indian Embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has invited
          Badruddin Haqqani, the envoy for the Taliban, to attend the Republic
          Day celebrations in Abu Dhabi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Badruddin Haqqani, one of the sons of Jalaluddin Haqqani, was
          appointed as Ambassador in October 2023. His brother, Sirajuddin
          Haqqani, serves as the Interior Minister of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Haqqani network, comprised of prominent Taliban leaders, was
          involved in several terrorist attacks including the 2008 attack on the
          Indian Embassy in Kabul.
        </p>
        <p>
          A copy of the invitation, issued by Indian Ambassador to UAE Sunjay
          Sudhir, was shared on Twitter by Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary, now
          based outside of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          New Delhi&apos;s perspective is that the Indian government has been
          engaging with the Taliban since it sent a technical team and reopened
          the Indian Embassy in Kabul. Thus, inviting Badruddin Haqqani aligns
          with that approach, sources said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources said the invitation was addressed to the envoy of the
          &quot;Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.&quot; The Taliban refers to
          itself as the &quot;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan;&quot; the
          &quot;Islamic Republic of Afghanistan&quot; was represented by former
          President Ashraf Ghani.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carefully navigating the issue, India has been engaging with the
          Taliban in Kabul but has not yet granted diplomatic recognition to the
          Taliban regime. The Indian government is following the template of the
          international community - engaging with the Taliban without officially
          recognizing them per UN standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afghanistan&apos;s Consuls General in Mumbai and Hyderabad announced
          in November 2022 that they would keep the Afghan Embassy in New Delhi
          open and operational – its closure was announced by Farid Mamundzay,
          the ousted government’s Ambassador to India, who termed the Consuls
          General as Taliban representatives. Given this, India is examining
          three key indicators that do not amount to India&apos;s de facto
          recognition of the Taliban regime:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the new leadership will continue flying the Islamic Republic of
          Afghanistan&apos;s tricolor flag, not the Taliban&apos;s white flag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the Embassy will retain the old name - the Islamic Republic of
          Afghanistan, instead of the Taliban’s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, no new Taliban-appointed diplomats will join the Afghan Embassy
          in Delhi or the consulates in Mumbai and Hyderabad.
        </p>
        <p>
          India’s red lines were conveyed to the new team, and the Afghan
          Consuls General have promised officials in India&apos;s Ministry of
          External Affairs that they will comply.
        </p>
        <p>
          India has been cautious, not labeling them Taliban representatives if
          they adhere to these commitments.
