          In northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border, an unmanned aerial
          drone attack resulted in the death of three U.S. service members, with
          34 others sustaining injuries, as reported by President Joe Biden and
          U.S. officials on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden attributed the attack to Iran-backed groups, stating,
          &quot;While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know
          it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in
          Syria and Iraq.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          A U.S. official informed Reuters that at least 34 personnel were
          undergoing evaluation for possible traumatic brain injuries. Another
          official commented, &quot;While we’re still gathering facts, this is
          most assuredly the work of an Iranian-backed militia group.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          These casualties mark the first fatalities of U.S. troops in the
          region since the conflict in Gaza. President Biden revealed that the
          attack occurred on Saturday night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident significantly escalates the already tense situation in
          the Middle East, where conflict erupted in Gaza following an attack by
          the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, resulting in
          1,200 casualties. Israel&apos;s subsequent assault on Gaza has led to
          the death of over 26,000 Palestinians, according to the local health
          ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the United States officially maintaining that it is not at war
          in the region, it has conducted strikes against targets of
          Yemen&apos;s Houthi groups, which have been attacking commercial
          vessels in the Red Sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden asserted, &quot;We will carry on their commitment to
          fight terrorism. And have no doubt – we will hold all those
          responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our
          choosing,&quot; as stated in his White House-released statement.

          Parliamentary proceedings in the Maldives ground to a halt on Sunday
          as a physical altercation erupted among members. Videos captured the
          clash between Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) MP Isa and Peoples’
          National Congress (PNC) MP Abdullah Shaheem Abdul Hakeem. Footage from
          the online news outlet Adhadhu depicted Shaheem grabbing Isa&apos;s
          leg, resulting in both members falling. Isa was seen kicking
          Shaheem&apos;s neck and pulling his hair in the scuffle, while other
          members intervened to push Shaheem out of the area. Local media
          reported that an injured parliament member was taken to an ambulance.

          Environmental officials in Ohio returned to the site of a devastating
          tanker truck crash on Sunday, aiming to manage the aftermath of a
          significant diesel fuel spill resulting from the incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crash, which occurred on Saturday morning and tragically claimed
          the life of the driver, involved a tanker carrying approximately 7,500
          gallons (28,390 liters) of diesel, as reported by the Ohio
          Environmental Protection Agency. Following the accident, a nearby
          creek briefly ignited, prompting swift action from the agency to
          contain the fuel spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address the environmental impact, response crews are set to
          excavate affected soil, according to the state EPA. Officials will
          maintain a presence at the scene to ensure comprehensive measures are
          taken to safeguard the well-being of residents and protect waterways,
          the agency stated in a press release.

          The incident unfolded around 9:15 am on Saturday, with the Summit
          County Sheriff’s Office and Macedonia Police Department responding to
          the scene at the ramp to Interstate 271 north in Northfield Center
          Township. The tanker, traveling northbound on State Route 8, attempted
          to access Interstate 271 north when the driver lost control, leading
          the vehicle to go over the bridge&apos;s side, according to the
          sheriff’s office.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truck ultimately landed on the northbound lanes of State Route 8,
          triggering a fiery explosion. Fire departments that rushed to the
          scene discovered that the tanker driver had succumbed to injuries
          sustained in the crash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The severity of the accident necessitated the closure of several
          roads, and an investigation into the crash is currently underway.

          In eastern Afghanistan, separate traffic incidents have resulted in

          injuries, as confirmed by authorities on Sunday.

          The Sorabi district of Kabul province, situated on the primary highway
          connecting Kabul to the eastern Nangarhar province, witnessed ten
          collisions. These accidents claimed the lives of 17 people, including
          two children and four women, as reported by Khalid Zadran, the
          spokesperson for the Kabul police chief. Ten individuals sustained
          injuries in these crashes and were subsequently hospitalized for
          treatment.

          Simultaneously, four additional collisions occurred in the eastern

          Kabul and Nangarhar, resulting in the death of 15 people, according to
          a statement from the Laghman police chief. In other parts of Laghman
          province, one person lost their life, and six others were injured. The
          injured individuals were promptly transferred to nearby hospitals for
          necessary medical attention.
        </p>

          The prevalence of traffic accidents in Afghanistan is a recurrent
          issue, primarily attributed to substandard road conditions and the

          In an effort to salvage a border deal in Congress, President Joe Biden
          asserted on Saturday night that he is prepared to close the US-Mexico
          border promptly if lawmakers present him with a bill, which would also
          release funds for Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing concerns over his administration&apos;s handling of
          migration at the border and seeking to counter GOP criticism, Biden,
          at a political event in South Carolina, expressed his willingness to
          shut down the border &quot;right now&quot; if Congress approved the
          proposed deal. However, the framework has not been formally agreed
          upon by Senate Democrats and Republicans, and its future in the
          GOP-controlled House remains uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden emphasized the benefits of a bipartisan bill, stating it would
          be advantageous for America by fixing the broken immigration system
          and ensuring swift access for deserving individuals. He emphasized the
          need for Congress to act, asserting that such legislation would grant
          him emergency authority to close the border until it could be brought
          under control. If the proposed bill were law at present, he claimed he
          would promptly shut down the border and address the situation
          expeditiously.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deal under negotiation in Congress stipulates that the US must
          close the border if approximately 5,000 migrants cross illegally in a
          single day, a response to some one-day totals last year that exceeded
          10,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Former President Donald Trump has been urging Republicans to oppose
          the negotiations, reluctant to give Biden a victory on an issue
          central to the Republican&apos;s successful 2016 campaign and crucial
          to his ambitions to return to the White House. While negotiators
          seemed close to reaching an agreement, Trump&apos;s influence began to
          strain the deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a surprising claim, Biden, in a written statement on Friday
          evening, stated that the deal would grant him &quot;a new emergency
          authority&quot; to close the border, and he would use it the day the
          bill is signed into law. This assertion elicited astonishment and
          shock from immigrant advocates who perceive his policies as not
          aligning with the progressive approach they anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deirdre Schifeling, Chief Political and Advocacy Officer at the
          American Civil Liberties Union, expressed the sentiment of voters,
          stating that elected leaders should focus on fixing the immigration
          system. She urged Biden and Congress to abandon the proposed deal and
          respond to voters&apos; demands for fair and effective immigration
          policies that manage the border and treat people seeking safety with
          dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden is contending with challenges on multiple fronts, grappling with
          an influx of asylum seekers while also implementing stricter measures
          against those illegally crossing into the US. Democrats are becoming
          increasingly frustrated as asylum seekers inundate cities lacking the
          resources to adequately care for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responding to Biden&apos;s comments, House Speaker Mike Johnson,
          R-La., contended that congressional action is unnecessary for Biden to
          close the border and urged him to take immediate executive action to
          reverse the perceived catastrophe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immigration remains a significant concern for voters in the 2024
          election, with an AP-NORC poll revealing an increase in concerns about
          immigration from 27% to 35% since the previous year. The poll also
          indicated a heightened focus on immigration among Republicans, with
          55% considering it a priority for 2024, up from 45% in December 2022.
          Arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time
          high in December, with 249,785 arrests, marking a 31% increase from
          November and a 13% increase from December 2022, the previous record.
          The top nationalities among those arrested included Mexicans,
          Venezuelans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Colombians.

          Four months after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&apos;s
          assertion of a potential Indian connection to the killing of Khalistan
          separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar stirred diplomatic tensions, a senior
          Canadian official has revealed that India is actively cooperating with
          Canada to address the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canada&apos;s outgoing National Security Advisor, Jody Thomas, who
          retired after more than 35 years of public service, stated in an
          interview with Canadian news channel CTV that discussions with Indian
          counterparts have been productive, indicating progress in bilateral
          relations. She noted that India&apos;s collaboration with Canada in
          resolving the matter has improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas attributed the improved ties between Canada and India partly to
          the US indictment of Indian citizen Nikhil Gupta in an alleged plot to
          assassinate Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. She
          emphasized the significance of fostering a healthy relationship with
          India for Canada&apos;s engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Appointed as National Security and Intelligence Advisor to Prime
          Minister Trudeau in January 2022, Thomas has engaged in discussions on
          the Nijjar case with Indian NSA Ajit Doval since August 2023,
          including during the G20 Summit in Delhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian government has not officially responded to Thomas&apos;s
          statements. Diplomatic relations between the two countries soured
          following Trudeau&apos;s remarks in September 2023, alleging potential
          Indian involvement in Nijjar&apos;s killing. India refuted any
          government involvement, dismissing Trudeau&apos;s allegations as
          baseless.
        </p>
        <p>
          India&apos;s response to allegations by the US regarding a plot to
          target Khalistan separatists differed from its approach to Canada.
          While India initiated an inquiry committee in response to US
          allegations, it maintained that Canada did not provide specific
          evidence or inputs necessitating similar action.
        </p>
        <p>
          External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar clarified in Parliament that
          India&apos;s response varied based on the provision of inputs. He
          explained that while the US shared information, prompting an inquiry,
          Canada did not provide such evidence, hence precluding equitable
          treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed this sentiment in an interview
          with the Financial Times, emphasizing India&apos;s commitment to the
          rule of law and readiness to address any information provided
          regarding its citizens&apos; actions, whether positive or negative.

          Finding refuge on the balcony, Radhika wrapped a cloth around her
          mouth from the clothesline. &quot;I stayed there, desperately calling
          out to my family, but I couldn&apos;t perceive their presence.
          Firefighters eventually arrived and rescued me,&quot; she added.
          Tragically, her 40-year-old mother Gauri and 17-year-old brother
          perished in the blaze, along with Rachna (28) and her nine-month-old
          daughter Ruhi.

          Suffering burns on her arms and legs, Radhika was discharged from GTB
          Hospital the following day. She revealed that her brother had
          aspirations of pursuing a career in chartered accountancy after
          completing his twelfth grade. &quot;My father, Ashutosh, was away for
          a wedding... I wish my mother and brother could have been saved,&quot;
          Radhika lamented.

          Neither Rachna&apos;s husband nor the occupants of the fourth floor
          were present during the incident. Subsequently, the Delhi Police
          arrested the building landlord, 75-year-old Bharat Singh Chauhan, and
          his son, 25-year-old Mohit Chauhan, for operating a godown in the
          stilt parking area where fiber sheets and wipers were stored,
          obstructing the only staircase.

          DCP (Shahdara) Surendra Choudhary stated, &quot;They have been
          arrested for causing the death of the four persons due to their
          negligence and have been booked under IPC section 304A (causing death
          by negligence)... they used to dump their factory material near the
          stairs and turned the whole ground floor into a godown... prima facie,
          a short circuit occurred and the fire spread rapidly through the
          plastic material.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Delhi Fire Services Chief Atul Garg reported that the fire originated
          among the wipers, rubber, and cutting machine. The landlord&apos;s
          wife, 70-year-old Prabhawati, sustained burn injuries on her leg and
          was discharged the following day.
