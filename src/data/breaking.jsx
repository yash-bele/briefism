          A 37-year-old woman is in trouble with the Delhi Police for allegedly
          deceiving a five-star hotel in Aerocity by staying in a suite for two
          weeks, faking UPI payments amounting to Rs 5-7 lakh, and attempting to
          leave without settling her bills. The incident occurred at Pullman
          Hotel, and the accused, hailing from Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, is
          now under police scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman arrived in Delhi alone on December 30 to celebrate New
          Year&apos;s Eve and checked into the hotel. During her stay until
          January 13, she reportedly utilized the spa and other amenities,
          incurring an additional cost of Rs 2.11 lakh. To avoid being linked to
          the charges, she allegedly used a fake name when availing these
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FIR, filed on January 13 based on the complaint of a Pullman Hotel
          staff member, reveals that the woman was evasive during police
          questioning. Initially claiming to be a lawyer, suspicions arose about
          her actual occupation, with an officer suggesting she may run a gift
          shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman purportedly attempted to feign payment for the services
          using fake UPI receipts. She showcased transactions on a bank&apos;s
          UPI mobile application, but upon verification, it was revealed that
          the bank had not received any payment. The investigation also
          disclosed that she had utilized the hotel&apos;s spa and fitness
          center under a false identity, accumulating services worth Rs 2.11
          lakh. The FIR alleges that when confronted about the fraudulent bank
          transactions, she hesitated to present the actual bank statement and
          later tried to escape with her bags from the hotel lobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon being stopped by the hotel&apos;s security staff, she reportedly
          engaged in aggressive behavior, including scratching and abusing the
          staff. The police were called, and she was taken to the IGI Airport
          police station, where she was questioned and a case of cheating was
          registered against her.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the accused has been granted bail due to the bailable nature of
          the charges, the police are now collaborating with Andhra Pradesh
          authorities to gather information about her job, profile, and any
          potential criminal history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel staff was reportedly deceived for over two weeks as the
          woman presented different UPI and bank transaction receipts, and it
          took some time for the staff to scrutinize the bills and confront her.
          The Indian Express reached out to the Pullman Hotel front desk and the
          complainant for their response, which is awaited.

        <p>
          In December 2022, when Karnataka&apos;s Chief Minister hinted at
          lifting the ban on hijabs in educational institutions, Muskan Khan, a
          Muslim student who had discontinued her studies due to the ban,
          expressed her eagerness to resume her education. Khan had made
          headlines earlier in 2022 for defiantly wearing the hijab despite
          attempts by some Hindu boys to coerce her into removing it. After the
          statewide ban, she dropped out rather than remove her headscarf.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the ban was unjustified given it did not serve any legitimate
          public interest, Khan&apos;s stance raises a bigger question - why do
          young Muslims like her prioritize religious symbols over education,
          even giving up the latter?
        </p>
        <p>
          Reportedly, Khan has worn the hijab since childhood, perhaps from ages
          seven or eight. At that tender age, she could not have made an
          informed choice about religious identity markers. Her parents likely
          decided the hijab for her, normalizing it over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          This suggests that even if courts uphold the hijab as an exercise of
          the students&apos; right to free expression or conscience, their true
          autonomy can be questioned. The political theorist Isaiah Berlin
          differentiated between &quot;negative liberty&quot; - freedom from
          external constraints, and &quot;positive liberty&quot; - the autonomy
          to make uncoerced choices. So while courts may validate the
          students&apos; positive liberty, their negative liberty is debatable
          since coercion can take subtle forms beyond threats, like
          indoctrination. As Robert Sapolsky&apos;s recent book shows, free will
          can be distorted through various societal influences.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, many conservative Islamic schools in South India mandate
          the hijab as part of the uniform from primary to secondary levels.
          Moreover, many orthodox Muslim families make even young girls wear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problematic representations also exist, like images comparing hijabi
          and non-hijabi women to wrapped and unwrapped candies, insinuating
          only the &quot;wrapped&quot; women are protected from
          &quot;flies&quot;, i.e. harassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This indicates that the conditioning of Muslim girls into the hijab
          does occur. It raises doubts about the autonomy of students insisting
          on it inside or outside class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Significantly, the Quran does not prescribe any particular attire for
          women except modest clothing. It instructs women to &quot;lower their
          gaze&quot; - an instruction futile if in a full body veil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the word &quot;hijab&quot; occurs eight times in the Quran,
          but never denotes a headscarf. It refers to a metaphorical divide
          between people or things.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India, the hijab gained prominence mainly through the Indian
          Islamic scholar Abul Ala Maududi. His book &quot;Purdah and the Status
          of Women in Islam&quot; is widely cited by Muslim conservatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maududi insisted Muslim women cannot wear &quot;alluring&quot; clothes
          or display their beauty, but belong inside the household doing
          domestic duties. He blamed democracy and liberty for dissent against
          these views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Written in 1939, Maududi&apos;s shocking misconceptions have been
          circulating for over eighty years, spawning a paradox where free
          Muslim women use their liberty to impose patriarchal symbols in the
          name of a religion not mandating it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, while the hijab ban was discriminatory, the bigger
          issue is the insidious conditioning of girls into prioritizing
          patriarchy-sanctioned attire over education in the name of religion.
          Their autonomy is constrained by decades of misleading propaganda
          about what Islamic principles actually entail. Upholding freedom of
          religion must be accompanied by reforms to ensure genuine informed
          consent.

          A local leader of the Rajput group Karni Sena was shot dead in Uttar
          Pradesh&apos;s Badaun district late Monday night. The killing occurred
          when three brothers allegedly broke into the leader&apos;s home
          intending to abduct his 17-year-old daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Badaun police, the key perpetrator Somendra Singh, known
          as Nanhe, aged 32, was arrested Tuesday morning. A manhunt is underway
          for his two absconding brothers, Antu and Satendra, who live near the
          victim&apos;s house in Sadaullah Ganj village.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deceased, Sudhir Kumar Singh, 40, was the Badaun district vice
          president of the Karni Sena, a conservative Rajput group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sudhir&apos;s elder brother Rajiv Singh, a farmer, filed a police
          complaint stating the brothers infiltrated the house around 11pm while
          family members were in different rooms. Nanhe entered by scaling the
          wall and opened the main door to let in his brothers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They tried to forcefully take away Sudhir&apos;s daughter but her
          mother raised an alarm. Sudhir came to intervene and was overpowered
          and shot in the right thigh. Hearing gunfire, neighbors rushed over
          but the perpetrators had fled. Sudhir was taken to the district
          hospital but succumbed to excessive bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police said the accused and victim had a political rivalry. The
          accused had previously tried unsuccessfully to abduct Sudhir&apos;s
          daughter four months ago to settle scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key accused Nanhe has been jailed while efforts are ongoing to nab
          his absconding brothers. As a precaution, adequate police presence has
          been deployed in the village.
        </p>
        <p>
          The killing illustrates the law and order challenges persisting in
          parts of Uttar Pradesh. Political or personal rivalries often manifest
          in crimes like murder, abuse of women, kidnapping, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          While police claim crimes have reduced under the current government,
          opposition parties contest this. They argue high-profile crimes
          continue unabated while victims from marginalized communities fail to
          get justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Badaun murder has shades of a recent case in Lakhimpur Kheri where
          a Union Minister&apos;s son allegedly mowed down farmers protesting
          against the ruling party. Together, these incidents highlight
          lingering concerns over VIP criminality and immunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, police have acted swiftly in the Karni Sena leader&apos;s
          murder, already arresting one culprit. This sends the right signal
          that political affiliations or influence will not deter
          investigations. Extending this accountability to all cases can
          significantly improve law and order and public trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond policing, addressing the root causes behind crimes of passion
          and honor killings remains critical. Illiteracy, lack of economic
          opportunities, patriarchal mindsets, easy access to guns are all
          contributing factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state government should pursue meaningful reforms on these social
          determinants by partnering with community leaders. Eradicating VIP
          culture around crimes is one piece of restoring law and order. But
          creating an enabling social environment for vulnerable groups like
          women and lower castes is equally important. A multi-pronged strategy
          only can make Uttar Pradesh safer in the true sense.

          in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident occurred on Monday afternoon near the victim Kulsum
          Shaikh&apos;s home in Goregaon East. The accused Sanjay Pralhad Bayas
          allegedly approached Shaikh from behind and slit her throat using a
          blade when she was returning from college.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bayas is a resident of the same Santosh Nagar locality as Shaikh.
          Police said he had proposed to Shaikh before, but she had turned him
          down. This led to quarrels between Bayas and the girl&apos;s family,
          although things had settled later.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Shaikh screamed for help after the throat slitting, Bayas escaped
          from the scene. Shaikh was rushed to the hospital in critical
          condition. Once she stabilized, her statement was recorded and a case
          was registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaikh sustained a deep wound requiring four stitches. Police suspect
          Bayas was intoxicated during the attack. He was arrested on Tuesday
          and charged with attempt to murder.
        </p>
        <p>
          This appears to be an instance of intimate partner violence due to
          masculine resentment against rejection. Attacking a woman for denying
          a romantic or matrimonial alliance points to a patriarchal mindset
          that women&apos;s choices should be dictated by men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extreme method of slitting the throat also indicates premeditation
          and intention to grievously hurt or kill. Shaikh is fortunate to have
          survived the assault. Considering her young age and the trauma of this
          experience, her emotional recovery may require time and counselling.
        </p>
        <p>
          While intimate partner violence often takes place within homes, this
          incident in a public space in broad daylight is alarming. It
          highlights the sense of impunity emboldening perpetrators to commit
          such crimes openly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective law enforcement can create deterrence against gender-based
          violence. Sensitizing the police to respond swiftly and sensitively to
          such complaints is vital. But preventing such violence requires
          addressing systemic social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maharashtra records among the highest cases of crimes against women
          annually. While laws and policing are tightening, mindset change
          through education and awareness is equally critical. Boys and men must
          be oriented on respecting women&apos;s consent and choices from a
          young age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rejecting a romantic interest or proposal does not imply an affront to
          male dignity. Rather, accepting a woman&apos;s decision with grace
          demonstrates strength of character. Society must reinforce such
          progressive attitudes at homes, schools and through public campaigns.

          The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued directives to authorities in
          Maharashtra&apos;s Yavatmal district and Chhattisgarh&apos;s Raipur
          district regarding upcoming rallies by a Hindu group and BJP
          legislator. The court ordered measures to prevent potential hate
          speeches during the events over the next week.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta passed
          the directives on a plea by Shaheen Abdulla alleging recurring hate
          speeches across India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plea claimed a rally by the Hindu Janajagruti Samiti in Yavatmal
          on January 18 could involve hate speech. It also cited apprehensions
          of hate speech in Raipur during rallies by BJP MLA T. Raja Singh from
          January 19-25.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bench declined to prohibit the rallies as plea respondents were
          absent. However, it directed district magistrates and police chiefs of
          both districts to install CCTV cameras at rally venues to identify
          perpetrators if hate speeches occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CCTV footage can provide evidence for action against violators.
          The court reiterated its existing guidelines against hate speech and
          said authorities must ensure compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hate speech has become a growing concern with the potential to incite
          communal unrest and violence. The court aims to deter its use and
          enable accountability through surveillance of sensitive events.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, critics argue banning speech, even offensive speech, is
          legally and ethically questionable in a democracy with freedom of
          expression. Moreover, hate speech prohibitions are sometimes misused
          to suppress dissent.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the court has sought a balanced approach—allowing events subject
          to preventive monitoring. This upholds free speech while adding a
          layer of caution. Authorities can now adapt security to potential
          risks indicated by the court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much depends on strict implementation without overreach. Tolerance of
          different ideas is vital, distinguishing hate speech from legitimate
          criticism. Ultimately, no law or order solution can replace gradual
          social change towards diversity acceptance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside deterring hate speech, active public education campaigns to
          deconstruct prejudices and promote inclusivity are essential. The
          state and civil society groups must collaborate on this grassroots
          work for sustainable communal harmony.

          The Centre has initiated the process to evict former Trinamool
          Congress MP Mahua Moitra from her government accommodation in Delhi.
          On Tuesday, the Directorate of Estates issued an eviction notice
          asking Moitra to immediately vacate the bungalow allotted to her as an
          MP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moitra was expelled from the Lok Sabha last month over allegations of
          unethical conduct. Post her expulsion, the housing allotment was
          cancelled and she was earlier asked to vacate by January 7. However,
          she had not done so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Directorate then sent notices on January 8 and 12 seeking
          explanation on why she had not vacated despite cancellation. As there
          was still no compliance, the final eviction notice was issued.
          Officials will now be deputed to ensure the bungalow is vacated
          promptly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously on January 4, the Delhi High Court had allowed Moitra to
          approach the Directorate requesting an extension to continue occupying
          the accommodation. The rules permit overstay of up to six months in
          exceptional circumstances on payment of charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the court did not comment on the merits of the case and left the
          decision to the Directorate&apos;s discretion. It only observed that
          due process of issuing notice before eviction must be followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moitra was expelled after being found guilty of &quot;unethical
          conduct&quot; by the ethics committee of Lok Sabha. The allegations
          were regarding accepting expensive gifts from a businessman and
          sharing her Parliament website credentials with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case highlights the strict code of conduct expected from
          lawmakers. Any breaches or ethical violations can warrant serious
          disciplinary action as was seen in Moitra&apos;s expulsion.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the former MP, loss of housing is an additional penalty alongside
          expulsion. Housing is an important perk and its withdrawal adds to the
          magnitude of her punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, some argue penalizing elected representatives for misconduct
          must not extend to impacting duties towards constituents. As
          Moitra&apos;s term was cut short, continuity of her office and housing
          till next elections may have been fair.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the rules are clear that housing facilities are contingent on
          remaining an active MP. Moitra&apos;s prompt eviction sends a strong
          message that privileges come with commensurate accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The larger debate continues on strengthening parliamentary ethics and
          maintaining citizens&apos; trust. Moitra&apos;s case will serve as a
          reference on standards of probity expected from lawmakers across party
          lines.

    title: `IIM Calcutta Removes Acting Director Following Sexual Harassment Complaint`,
    preArticle: `The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C) has removed its
          Director-in-Charge, Professor Sahadeb Sarkar, over a sexual harassment
          complaint against him.`,
    article: (

        <p>
          The Indian Institute of Management Calcutta (IIM-C) has removed its
          Director-in-Charge, Professor Sahadeb Sarkar, over a sexual harassment
          complaint against him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a statement on Tuesday evening, IIM-C said Sarkar was removed based
          on the recommendation of the institute&apos;s Internal Complaints
          Committee (ICC). The ICC received a written sexual harassment
          complaint against Sarkar under the relevant law.
        </p>
        <p>
          After initial review, the ICC concluded that the allegations prima
          facie warrant a formal inquiry. It communicated this to IIM-C&apos;s
          Board of Governors (BoG).
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure impartiality during the impending inquiry, the BoG decided
          to remove Sarkar from the Director-in-Charge post and any other
          positions of administrative responsibility at IIM-C. This will apply
          for the duration of the ICC inquiry and resulting proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The senior-most faculty member, Professor Saibal Chattopadhyay, has
          been appointed as the new officiating Director-in-Charge with
          immediate effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development makes Sarkar the third IIM director in three years to
          not complete their tenure, preceding Uttam Kumar Sarkar and Anju Seth.
        </p>
        <p>
          This indicates the increased spotlight on abuse of power and gender
          sensitization in academic institutions, where sexual misconduct often
          gets brushed under the carpet.
        </p>
        <p>
          IIM-C&apos;s swift action shows zero tolerance for such allegations,
          especially against senior leadership. Removing the accused pending
          investigation is vital for unbiased, fair proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the rights of the accused person must also be upheld. IIM-C
          should ensure due process is followed before any conclusions are
          reached.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the case highlights the ongoing need to strengthen safeguards
          against sexual harassment and sensitize campus cultures. Educational
          institutions have a duty to lead by example in promoting gender
          justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strict policy enforcement signaled by Sarkar&apos;s removal combined
          with proactive sensitization can help India&apos;s premier institutes
          set positive precedents. The IIMs must drive change by their ethics as
          much as their academic excellence.
