          A series of strong earthquakes struck Japan on Monday, causing tsunami
          waves to rise as high as five feet. Local media reported that in
          response, authorities sent out evacuation advisories and tsunami
          warnings to people living along the nation's northwest coast.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earthquake affected Ishikawa and its surrounding prefectures,
          according to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), with one
          prefecture recording an initial magnitude of 7.6, as reported by The
          Associated Press. Following the earthquake, local weather agencies
          predicted that there would be tsunami waves within 300 kilometers of
          the Noto, Ishigawa, epicenter.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 4:06 PM local time, a 5.7 magnitude earthquake sparked the seismic
          activity. Subsequently, at 4:10 PM, a 7.6 magnitude earthquake, at
          4:18 PM, a 6.1 magnitude earthquake, at 4:23 PM local time, a 4.5
          magnitude event, at 4:29 PM local time, and at 4:32 PM local time, a
          4.6 magnitude earthquake.
        </p>
        <p>
          People facing a tsunami of more than one meter in height were "highly
          likely to be unable to stand, with the possibility of death,"
          according to a warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency
          (JMA), as reported by The Japan Times. The Japan Meteorological Agency
          (JMA) issued tsunami warnings along the western coasts of the
          prefectures of Ishikawa, Niigata, and Toyama, according to Reuters.
          According to NHK, waves in other prefectures such as Niigata and
          Toyama reached three meters in height.

          Many videos that have been going viral on social media show
          individuals being forced to shelter under tables and chairs as
          buildings tremble violently. Meanwhile powerful tsunami waves posed an
          immediate threat to coastal areas. The earthquake activity caused
          severe damage to surrounding roadways and fractures in them, resulting
          in the collapse of numerous dwellings.

          According to INSACOG's data updated on Monday, 196 cases of COVID-19
          sub-variant JN.1 have been found in the country to date, with Odisha
          entering the list of states that have detected the variant's presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The JN.1 sub-variant of the virus has been found in ten states and
          Union territories thus far. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium
          (INSACOG) lists these states as follows: Kerala (83), Goa (51),
          Gujarat (34), Karnataka (eight), Maharashtra (seven), Rajasthan
          (five), Tamil Nadu (four), Telangana (two), Odisha (one), and Delhi
          (one).
        </p>
        <p>
          According to INSACOG data, JN.1 was found in 179 out of the 179 Covid
          cases that were reported nationwide in December; the remaining 17
          cases had this detection in November. Despite its fast spreading
          nature, the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated JN.1 as a
          distinct "variant of interest" and stated that it presents a "low"
          danger to global public health.
        </p>
        <p>
          The international body stated that the JN.1 sub-variant of the
          coronavirus was previously categorized as a variation of interest
          (VOI) as a component of the parent lineage that is categorized as a
          VOI, the BA.2.86 sub-lineages. Nonetheless, JN.1 cases have been
          recorded from several nations in recent weeks, and the virus's
          incidence has risen sharply worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to an increase in Covid cases and the discovery of the JN.1
          sub-variant in the nation, the Center has requested that the states
          and Union territories keep a continuous watch. India now has 636 new
          coronavirus infections, while there are 4,394 ongoing cases, according
          to data released on Monday by the Health ministry.

          Gangster Goldy Brar, the mastermind behind the brutal murder of
          Punjabi singer Sidhu Moosewala, was on Monday declared a designated
          terrorist by the Centre under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act
          (UAPA).
        </p>
        <p>
          A key member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Brar had claimed
          responsibility for the murder of Moosewala, who was killed in a hail
          of bullets in Punjab’s Mansa district on May 29, 2022. A native of
          Faridkot in Punjab, Brar, whose real name is Satinderjit Singh, went
          to Canada on a student visa in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          While claiming responsibility for Mooosewala’s murder, Brar had said
          in a Facebook post, “Sachin Bishnoi Dhattaranwali, Lawrence Bishnoi,
          and I are behind the killing of Sidhu Moosewala.” The gangster had
          claimed that he killed Moosewala to avenge the death of Youth Akali
          Dal leader Vicky Middukhera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brar had also claimed responsibility for the murder of Dera follower
          Pardeep Singh Kataria in Kotkapura in 2022. An accused in the 2015
          Bargari sacrilege case, Kataria was out on bail and was shot dead at
          his shop by a group of six men on November 11 that year. Brar is also
          allegedly involved in an extortion racket being run in Punjab and is
          believed to have had a hand in the murder of Youth Congress leader
          Gurlal Pehalwan.

          After a 21-minute flight, the Indian Space Research Organization
          (ISRO) launched the X-ray Polarimeter Satellite (XPoSat), its first
          polarimetry mission, into an exact circular orbit of 650 km on Monday
          morning, January 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second satellite-based mission in the world devoted to measuring
          X-ray polarimetry is known as XPoSat. India's first mission to analyze
          the polarization of X-rays emitted from bright celestial sources in
          the medium frequency band is called X-ray Polarimeter Satellite
          (XPoSat). Indian X-ray Polarimeter (POLIX) and X-ray Spectroscopy and
          Timing (XSPECT) are the two payloads that make up XPoSat. The Raman
          Research Institute and the UR Rao Satellite Centre, both in Bengaluru,
          are the organizations that constructed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Low earth orbit (about 650 km, with a low inclination of about 6
          degrees) is the designated observational orbit for the spacecraft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of its projected five-year mission, XPoSat will
          observe sources that produce polarized X-rays. The observations will
          take place, for example, during the eclipse period, when the
          magnetars, also known as neutron stars, are passing through the
          Earth's shadow. These stars are extremely magnetic and exhibit a wide
          range of X-ray activity.

          This is the most advanced technology ever developed, and it gets
          stronger every second. Because of this, the past year has been
          extraordinary; never before have technological advancements and
          everything related to them changed so swiftly that it is now
          challenging to predict our future.

          In Bihar, eight people have been taken into custody for allegedly
          paying men ₹ 13 lakh to get women who were infertile pregnant.

          The arrests took place in Nawada, Bihar. According to the police, the
          accused would reach out to men on social media and WhatsApp, offering
          them the chance to make thousands of rupees in exchange for their
          "service". A ₹ 799 registration fee was required of the interested
          men. The group gave them some pictures after they registered and asked
          them to select the woman they wanted to get pregnant. Afterwards, a
          security deposit of ₹ 5 to ₹ 20,000 was requested of them, depending
          on how "attractive the woman was."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The men were informed that should the woman become pregnant, they
          would receive ₹ 13 lakh. Superintendent of Police in Nawada Kalyan
          Anand stated, "They were promised a consolation price of ₹ 5 lakh even
          if they failed to impregnate the woman." Following a raid in Nawada by
          a Bihar police Special Investigation Team (SIT), the arrests were
          made. Officials stated that police have located cell phones and a
          printer on the premises and that they are still looking for the other
          suspects, including the mastermind.

          broke out in Manipur on May 3. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent
          of Manipur’s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals
          — Nagas and Kukis — constitute little over 40 per cent and reside in
