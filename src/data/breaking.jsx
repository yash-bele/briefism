        Dozens of &quot;fake&quot; websites and mobile applications that purport
        to defraud people out of their cryptocurrency investments are the
        subject of an investigation by the Delhi Police. Although no one has
        been taken into custody as of yet, police stated that they have combined
        numerous complaints from the Special Cell, cyber cells, and the National
        Cybercrime Reporting Portal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Police said on Tuesday that they had filed a formal complaint against a
        cryptocurrency investment company. The platform CoinDCX is mentioned in
        the last-month-registered FIR.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, CoinDCX stated that the current situation involved
        &quot;fraudulent websites/URLs&quot; impersonating the CoinDCX exchange.
        <br />
        <br />
        When a 24-year-old Chattarpur engineer tried to withdraw the nearly Rs
        14 lakh he had invested using the app last month, he was prompted to
        transfer an additional Rs 4.65 lakh, from which tax would be withheld.
        Additional complainants claimed they were &quot;forced&quot; to pay more
        in order to receive a refund.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the company, the incident was the result of a phony website
        scam and had nothing to do with the CoinDCX app or website.
        &quot;It&apos;s important to note that a number of fraudulent websites
        and URLs are posing as financial apps in an attempt to trick users—a
        problem that many fintech companies and financial applications,
        including cryptocurrency apps, must deal with. We have quickly notified
        CERT of these threats. A company spokesperson stated, &quot;Our
        compliance team met with representatives from MeiTY and I4C, gave them
        the list of misleading websites, and we are asking for their help in
        taking them down. The company went on to say that over 100 phony
        profiles had been made using its name in an attempt to trick investors
        and users.
        <br />
        <br />
        An officer stated, &quot;We haven't received an official complaint from
        the firm yet. We have received complaints about Telegram channels and
        phony cryptocurrency platforms. We filed FIRs and will look into the
        situation. Many cryptocurrency portals and platforms defraud people who
        invest in Bitcoin. People take advantage of the lack of regulations
        surrounding cryptocurrencies and defraud investors.&quot;

        The accused, 45-year-old scrap dealer Ravi Nagar, also known as Ravi
        Kana, and his gang, are being targeted by Gautam Buddha Nagar Police,
        following a complaint filed by a 25-year-old woman claiming she was
        gangraped in the Gardens Galleria Mall parking lot in June of last year.
        Teams have been assembled to apprehend Kana, but on Wednesday, the
        Greater Noida police sealed his properties, which are valued at Rs 100
        crore.
        <br />
        <br />
        The woman claimed she was threatened by the accused and was unable to
        file the complaint until December 30. The men used the guise of a job to
        entice her. She went to the police when they began using the
        incident&apos;s videos as blackmail. Kana was one of five men named in a
        gangrape lawsuit. There are three men in custody: Rajkumar Nagar, Azad
        Nagar, and Vikas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Following this incident, police began investigating Kana&apos;s other
        endeavors. The UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act,
        1986 has been used to charge Kana, his gang members, and his wife, per
        the directives of Gautam Buddha Nagar Police Commissioner Laxmi Singh.
        Anil was the man who was arrested in this instance.
        <br />
        <br />
        A combined team from the Beta 2 and Ecotech 1 police stations raided
        factories connected to Kana on Tuesday, according to DCP (Greater Noida)
        Saad Miya Khan. Raids at Shri Krishna Steels and Prime Processing Tools
        Private Limited resulted in the sealing of 20 empty trucks, 10 computers
        with printers, 3 motorcycles, 2 tractors, and 2 trucks loaded with
        scrap. The sealed scrap material and additional items are valued at
        approximately Rs 100 crore. Khan stated, &quot;The other accused in the
        case will be arrested shortly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Kana used to work illegally as a scrap dealer for Anil Dujana, a
        notorious gangster. However, weeks prior to Dujana&apos;s death in an
        altercation with UP Police in May of last year, the two had a falling
        out.
        <br />
        <br />
        It should be noted that following the shooting death of his brother
        Harendra Pradhan in Greater Noida in February 2015, Kana was placed
        under police protection. &quot;On July 25, 2023, his security was
        removed following an investigation,&quot; stated Ashok Kumar, ADCP
        (Greater Noida).
        <br />
        <br />
        According to officials, Kana&apos;s gang would obstruct trucks that were
        en route to construction sites and, working with the drivers, unload
        rebar at a predetermined spot. &quot;They gained unjustified financial
        advantages by offering traders rebar at market value. Additionally, by
        threatening business owners, they would secure contracts for scrap
        material at the desired rate, according to a senior police officer.

        After being detained for almost seven years in relation to a
        gangster&apos;s murder case, Divya Pahuja was free on bond.
        <br />
        <br />
        On Wednesday, Divya Pahuja, a 27-year-old woman suspected of being
        involved in the purportedly staged encounter with notorious gangster
        Sandeep Gadoli, was shot and killed in a hotel room close to the
        Gurugram bus stop.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pahuja, a resident of Sector-7 in Gurugram&apos;s Baldev Nagar, was free
        on bond following nearly seven years of detention in relation to
        Gadoli&apos;s death. On February 7, 2016, the gangster was killed in a
        Mumbai hotel. Pahuja, her mother, and five police officers were taken
        into custody in connection with the gangster&apos;s murder.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the Mumbai Police, Gadoli&apos;s girlfriend Pahuja assisted
        the police officers in luring him into the hotel. In addition, the
        police claimed that Virendra Kumar, also known as Binder Gujjar, was the
        leader of an opposing gang and had plotted Gadoli&apos;s death with
        Haryana Police officers.

              <span className="font-normal">*</span> Pahuja&apos;s death was
              discovered when her sister Naina went to the police, believing
              there had been foul play, after her family was unable to get in
              touch with her. She reported to the police that her sister had
              last been seen at a hotel in the city that was owned by
              56-year-old Abhijeet Singh.

              <span className="font-normal">*</span> When a police squad finally

              covered in a bed sheet toward the hotel&apos;s main entrance and
              load it into a blue BMW, the team looked through the hotel&apos;s

            <li>
              <span className="font-normal">*</span> &quot;The crime was

              him and that she had some of his private photos.

        NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) leader Jitendra Awhad questioned how Lord
        Ram, a vegetarian, could have survived in the jungle for fourteen years.
        <br />
        <br />
        The BJP has demanded that January 22, the day of the consecration of the
        Ram Temple in Ayodhya, be declared a dry day and that all non-vegetarian
        food be banned. Maharashtra leader Jitendra Awhad&apos;s remark that
        Lord Ram was never a vegetarian because he couldn&apos;t live in the
        jungle for 14 years as a vegetarian has sparked a major controversy in
        the state. According to the Nationalist Congress Party MLA (Sharad Pawar
        faction), Lord Ram was a hunter and a Bahujan who did not follow a
        vegetarian diet. &quot;We forget everything in politics and don&apos;t
        read history. We own Ram. Of us Bahujans. Who used to hunt to eat… Ram
        was never a vegetarian. He was a non-vegetarian&quot;. Jitendra Awhad
        questioned &quot;how a man who spent 14 years living in the bush could
        continue to be a vegetarian&quot;.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shiv Sena&apos;s Saamana newspaper would have criticized the &apos;Ram
        non-vegetarian&apos; remark if Balasaheb Thackeray had been alive,
        according to BJP MLA Ram Kadam. &quot;But in the actual world of today,
        the Uddhav Sena does not seem to mind if someone makes fun of Hindus.
        They are apathetic and as frigid as ice. However, they will bring up
        Hindutva when the election time comes.&quot; Thursday, Ram Kadam posted
        a tweet.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ram Kadam demanded in a letter to Chief Minister Eknath Shinde that
        January 22 be set aside as a vegetarian and dry day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Jitendra Awhad responded to the controversy his remark caused by asking,
        &quot;What is the controversy about what did Lord Ram eat? There was no
        rice back then, but someone will say that Lord Ram used to eat
        methi-bhaji, or fritters made from fenugreek leaves. Because Kshatriyas
        are not vegetarians, Lord Ram was a Kshatriya. I wholeheartedly support
        what I said. In addition to being non-vegetarians, 80% of Indians are
        followers of Lord Ram&quot;, Jitendra Awhad said.
        <br />
        <br />
        Priest Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of Shri Ram Janambhoomi
        Teerth Kshetra, refuted Awhad&apos;s claim, stating that scriptures
        record that Lord Ram ate fruits when he was in exile. &quot;Jitendra
        Awhad, the leader of the NCP, is saying things that are wholly untrue.
        Nowhere in our scriptures is it mentioned that Lord Ram ate
        non-vegetarian food while he was in exile. It states that he once
        consumed fruits. It is not right for such a liar to disparage our Lord
        Ram. Our God was a vegetarian from the beginning. He is insulting our
        Lord Ram by using derogatory language,&quot; the priest remarked.

        The names of friends and inner circle members of disgraced financier and
        sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away in jail in 2019 while
        awaiting federal sex-trafficking charges, were revealed in nearly 1,000
        pages of court records that had previously been redacted. The records
        were unsealed on Wednesday. The expected revelations have generated a
        lot of buzz and speculation. CNN reported on what is known about the
        documents and why they are important.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">Jeffrey Epstein: who was he?</span>
          <span>
            Epstein, a multimillionaire known for his connections to
            politicians, celebrities, billionaires, and elite academics, was
            first detained in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2005 on suspicion of
            paying a 14-year-old girl for sex. However, in 2008, prosecutors
            permitted him to enter a guilty plea to a charge pertaining to a
            single victim. He participated in a jail work-release program for 13
            months.
          </span>
          <span>
            There were allegations of similar sexual abuse from dozens of other
            minor girls. While many of his well-known acquaintances, including
            former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, abandoned Epstein
            after his conviction, many others did not. For ten more years,
            Epstein remained in the company of the wealthy and well-known,
            frequently through charitable endeavors.
          </span>
          <span>
            In 2019, Epstein was charged with sex trafficking by federal
            prosecutors in New York due to renewed interest in the scandal
            following Miami Herald reporting. While in custody awaiting trial,
            he committed suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein&apos;s
            ex-girlfriend, was subsequently charged by the US attorney in
            Manhattan for aiding in the recruitment of his minor victims.
            According to Guardian, she was found guilty in 2021 and is currently
            incarcerated for 20 years.
          </span>

        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">
            What is the subject matter of these records?
          </span>
          <span>
            The documents that are being made public are a part of a lawsuit
            that Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein&apos;s victims, filed against
            Maxwell in 2015. Giuffre was one of Epstein&apos;s victims who sued
            him, claiming that he had mistreated her at his homes in Florida,
            New York, the US Virgin Islands, and New Mexico. When Giuffre turned
            seventeen, she said, she was enticed to leave her position as a spa
            attendant at Trump&apos;s Mar-a-Lago club in order to work as a
            &quot;masseuse&quot; for Epstein, which involved engaging in sexual
            acts.
          </span>
          <span>
            She further claimed that she was coerced into having sex with Prince
            Andrew of Britain and other men in Epstein&apos;s social circle. Her
            accounts were refuted by all the accused men as being false. In
            2022, Giuffre and Prince Andrew reached a settlement in court. She
            retracted her accusation against law professor Alan Dershowitz,
            Epstein&apos;s former attorney, in the same year, saying she
            &quot;may have made a mistake&quot; in designating him as an abuser.
          </span>
          <span>
            Despite the fact that Giuffre and Maxwell&apos;s lawsuit was
            resolved in 2017, the Miami Herald requested judicial intervention
            in order to obtain court documents that had been initially filed
            under seal, including transcripts of attorney-client interviews with
            possible witnesses. A court unsealed about 2,000 pages in 2019, and
            more documents surfaced in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The privacy rights
            of Epstein&apos;s victims and other people whose names surfaced
            during the legal battle but who were not involved in his crimes had
            caused this next batch of records to stay sealed.

        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-2">
          <span className="text-xl">What is contained in the files?</span>
          <span>
            US District Judge Loretta A. Preska evaluated the documents to
            decide what should be unsealed. She made the decision to release the
            records in December, stating that a large portion of the information
            contained therein was already known to the public. In other court
            cases, some records have been made public, either in full or in
            part. A large portion of the remaining material deals with subjects
            and characters that have been thoroughly covered in newspaper
            articles, TV documentaries, books, interviews, and testimony during
            Maxwell&apos;s criminal trial over the course of nearly 20 years.

            Numerous accusers of Epstein, staff members who told tabloid
            newspapers about their experiences, witnesses at Maxwell&apos;s
            trial, people mentioned in passing during depositions but not
            implicated in any scandalous activities, and investigators of
            Epstein, including prosecutors, a journalist, and a detective, are
            among the names listed in the records. The judge added that there
            are also prominent figures&apos; names in boldface who are known to
            have had relationships with Epstein over the years, but whose
            relationships have already been thoroughly reported elsewhere.

            Among them is Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent who was close
            to Epstein and committed suicide in a Paris jail in 2022 while
            awaiting trial on allegations that he had sexually assaulted minors.
            Among the women who had accused Brunel of sexual abuse was Giuffre.
            Both Trump and Clinton are mentioned in the court file, in part
            because Giuffre was questioned by Maxwell&apos;s attorneys regarding
            errors in press articles regarding her time spent with Epstein,
            according to the Guardian.

            She was cited in one story as saying that she flirted with Trump and
            went on a helicopter ride with Clinton. According to Giuffre, none
            of those events occurred in reality. She doesn&apos;t seem to have
            implicated any of the former presidents. The judge stated that
            certain names ought to be kept off the records since they would
            identify victims of sexual abuse.

            Why is everyone&apos;s attention focused on new documents?
          </span>
          <span>
            The high-profile associates are what have drawn attention to the
            latest revelation in the documents. Federal Judge Loretta Preska in
            Manhattan unsealed the documents, which included the names of
            numerous people identified as associates, affiliates, or victims of
            Epstein in a civil lawsuit filed in 2015.
          </span>
          <span>
            According to US-based NPR, the documents contain references to a
            number of people, including former Vice President Al Gore, magician
            David Copperfield, actor Kevin Spacey, lawyer Alan Dershowitz, late
            New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, and former Israeli Prime
            Minister Ehud Barak.

        The inclusion of names in these documents does not imply that any of the
        individuals are the subject of accusations or proof of wrongdoing.Due to
        earlier court cases or media revelations, a large number of the most
        well-known people—including American politicians, members of British
        royalty, tech tycoons, and bankers—were already known to be connected to
        Epstein. The majority of those who have been made public have denied any
        misconduct or prior knowledge of Epstein&apos;s illegal actions.
