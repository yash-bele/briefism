          As the prolonged winter break ends, schools in Delhi are set to resume
          in-person classes starting today, January 15, 2024. However, as a
          preemptive measure considering the ongoing cold wave conditions and
          foggy weather, school timings have been modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a directive issued by the Education Department on Sunday,
          no schools will commence sessions before 9 AM or continue beyond 5 PM
          until further notice. This adjusted schedule applies to all students
          in government, government-aided, and recognized private schools,
          including those in nursery, kindergarten, and primary sections. The
          order stated that the standard reporting time remains unchanged for
          all teaching and non-teaching faculty.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With the aim of exercising caution given the current foggy
          circumstances, no school (including those with double shifts) will
          begin before 9 AM or have classes after 5 PM until additional
          guidelines are provided,&quot; the order outlined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, on January 7th, Delhi&apos;s Education Minister Atishi
          announced that the winter break would be prolonged until January 12th
          for students from nursery to 5th standard, in light of the severe cold
          wave conditions in the national capital. &quot;Schools in Delhi will
          stay closed for the next 5 days owing to the ongoing cold weather, for
          students from nursery to class 5,&quot; Atishi had tweeted at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Delhi recorded its lowest temperature this winter season so
          far, with the mercury plummeting to 3.5 degrees Celsius. The cold
          intensified further in the Lodhi Road area, where the minimum
          temperature fell to 3.4 degrees Celsius.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most parts of Delhi-NCR were enveloped in dense fog, bringing
          visibility on roads down to zero.

          The ongoing tensions in the Red Sea resulting from repeated assaults
          on commercial vessels by Yemen’s Houthi rebels are negatively
          impacting the global supply chain. This could lead to a $10-20
          increase in oil prices for major oil importing countries such as
          India, according to World Economic Forum (WEF) President Borge Brende.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an exclusive interview with India Today TV/Business Today and News
          Director Rahul Kanwal, Brende stated that closing the Suez Canal would
          be detrimental for the global supply chain. He expressed hope that the
          Houthi attacks in the region would cease soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brende made these remarks just as the 54th annual World Economic Forum
          meeting is set to commence in the scenic city of Davos, Switzerland.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the interview, Brende highlighted that trade growth fell to
          0.8% last year compared to 3.4%. However, he remained optimistic that
          global trade will “pick up a bit” this year, despite the Red Sea
          crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;However, it doesn’t take much to also have a negative impact on
          this if we close the Red Sea. Even closing the Suez Canal for weeks
          will have a very negative impact on the global supply chain. So, a lot
          is at stake. We also know that this has an impact on oil prices and
          for major oil-importing countries like India, where a $10-20 increase
          in oil prices will have very negative effects on the economy,&quot; he
          explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;So, I hope that this will not escalate further and that shipping
          can resume as usual in the Red Sea in a few days,&quot; he added.

            India’s Economy Projected to Grow 8% in 2023

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Brende was optimistic regarding the Indian economy, projecting 8%
              growth this year. &quot;We think, in the coming decade, we can be
              speaking about a $10 trillion economy, at least in the coming two
              decades,&quot; he stated.
            </p>
            <p>
              He praised India&apos;s growth narrative, noting that the country
              was developing its digital economy twice as fast as the rest of
              the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;India has been at the forefront due to the digital economy
              and the export of services. This is a very sweet spot for India.
              But, of course, reforms should continue in India. Reforms related
              to education, funding and reforms to tackle unnecessary red tape
              should continue. I feel there is an understanding of all these
              things in New Delhi,&quot; Brende remarked.

            <p>
              Acknowledging India&apos;s increasing global prominence, Brende
              cited an example where there was a &quot;long waiting list&quot;
              of Indian officials waiting to meet him in a room that could only
              accommodate &quot;100 people&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;We have a lot of Indian companies here. India is growing
              very fast. There&apos;s a lot of interest in India. There is a
              country strategy meeting on India where the three ministers that
              are here will conduct, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
              Governor is here too. I was told by my team that it was
              oversubscribed after half an hour. So, there&apos;s a long waiting
              list,&quot; he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;I think we can only fit 100 of them in the room. They are
              still waiting and they can&apos;t get in and they are upset. So, I
              said, maybe we will have to look for a bigger room,&quot; he
              chuckled.

            <p>
              Discussing global economic growth, Brende stated that the WEF
              projected 2.9% growth this year but was hopeful it could surpass
              3% soon. &quot;We should also acknowledge that many economists
              expected a recession in the US, the largest economy constituting
              25% of global GDP. But there is no recession. It&apos;s probably a
              soft landing. We&apos;re seeing inflation abating a bit. Interest
              rates will then go down,&quot; he explained.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;For India, I think if trade grows again and India gets a
              little more tailwind from the global economy in 2025, I think, as
              I said earlier, India could be a $10 trillion economy in the
              medium to long term, provided reforms continue,&quot; he added.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Brende, the upcoming elections in India, the US, the
              UK, Russia and the European Parliament will have a “huge impact”
              on the global economic outlook this &quot;election year&quot;.

            <p>
              Elaborating on the WEF 2024 theme of rebuilding trust in a
              fractured world, Brende emphasized the need for global
              collaboration due to a “clear trust deficit”.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;There is also huge geopolitical competition. But even in a
              fractured, fragmented world, we need to collaborate. Some of the
              most pressing challenges are global – future pandemics, climate
              change, cyber attacks. We also know, for example, from the war in
              Gaza that we need to collaborate now, so this doesn’t escalate
              further,&quot; he stated.

          A video circulating online depicts an IndiGo passenger punching the
          captain while he was making an announcement regarding flight delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The widely shared footage has provoked numerous reactions from social
          media users calling for action against the passenger. However, some
          pointed to the frustration among travelers given IndiGo&apos;s pileup
          of complaints over cancellations, unreasonable delays, and subpar
          service standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video shows the captain making a statement about delays. Suddenly,
          a passenger wearing a yellow hoodie rushes up and slaps the captain
          across the face. A flight attendant standing next to the captain
          immediately intervenes, shielding the captain and trying to defuse the
          situation. The attacker is then pulled back by another man in a sky
          blue hoodie as commotion spreads in the cabin.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Sir, you cannot do this,&quot; the flight attendant is heard
          saying as she protects the captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many passengers can be heard justifying the passenger&apos;s behavior,
          blaming IndiGo for the delays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The captain had announced the delays after replacing the previous crew
          owing to Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) regulations following
          several hours of waiting. The viral video stated the flight was
          &quot;13 hours&quot; delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FDTL rules mandate adequate rest periods for pilots and crew to
          reduce fatigue, established by the Directorate General of Civil
          Aviation (DGCA).
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes amid a barrage of complaints against IndiGo on social
          media, with numerous accounts of delays and chaos. On Saturday, actor
          Radhika Apte shared her terrible experience after being confined on an
          aerobridge at Mumbai airport for hours along with fellow travelers.
          She said IndiGo staff were clueless, depriving passengers including
          seniors and infants of food and restroom breaks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flight operations have been hampered the past few days due to harsh
          winter fog across North and Central India.
