          Ahead of the Pran Pratishtha ceremony on January 22nd in Ayodhya, the
          Union Health Ministry and Uttar Pradesh government have instituted
          medical preparedness measures expecting lakhs of devotees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials estimate hundreds of thousands of devotees and 8,000
          invitees will attend the Monday event.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be two fully equipped field hospitals - a 20-bed facility
          at Tulsi Udyan and a 10-bed facility at Tent City - along with 16
          first-aid booths for devotees. A control room will also be set up in
          the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          A team from Delhi&apos;s AIIMS trauma centre has trained healthcare
          workers deployed in Ayodhya in basic life support, CPR and triage
          techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Union Health Secretary and Director General of Health Services
          recently visited to inspect and bolster medical infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vector control and disease surveillance measures have been implemented
          to prevent any outbreaks. While mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue
          are uncommon in winter, respiratory infections from Covid-19 and
          influenza have risen across Indian cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to on-site facilities, the bed capacity at the local
          medical college has been increased from 350 to 550 beds as backup.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government&apos;s portable Arogya Maitri BHISM emergency hospital
          with medical cubes is on standby if required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hospitals in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and neighbouring states have been
          alerted to remain on standby for unforeseen emergencies. A designated
          team is ready for rapid deployment, the Health Ministry stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ministry is also enhancing health facilities at the Ayodhya
          airport.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, elaborate medical arrangements including field hospitals,
          first-aid booths, disease surveillance, backup beds, portable
          emergency infrastructure and trained personnel have been deployed in
          Ayodhya ahead of the high-profile temple ceremony expecting massive
          crowds.

          RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has appealed for an end to the
          &quot;bitterness&quot;, &quot;dispute&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot;
          surrounding the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The conflict that has arisen for and against the dispute should

          end. Enlightened members of society must ensure the dispute is
          resolved completely. Ayodhya means a city free from war and
          conflict,&quot; he stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagwat said the temple consecration marks the &quot;beginning of
          rebuilding Bharatvarsh&quot;. Along with reconstructing the temple, we
          have pledged to rebuild India and thereby pave the way to reconstruct
          the entire world, he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blaming &quot;politics of appeasement&quot;, he said that after
          independence, the unanimous renovation of Somnath temple sparked
          discussions about other places of worship. A similar consensus could
          have been reached regarding Ram Janmabhoomi, but politics took a
          different turn with the rise of discrimination and appeasement. So the
          issue remained unresolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Successive governments disregarded the wishes and sentiments of Hindus
          on this matter. Instead they tried to thwart initiatives taken by
          society. The legal battle dating back to pre-independence times
          continued. The mass movement demanding liberation of Ram&apos;s
          birthplace began in the 1980s and went on for 30 years, he pointed
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagwat said India&apos;s history is one of constant struggle against
          invaders for the past 1500 years. Attacks by Islamist forces from the
          West brought utter destruction and fractured society. Destroying
          native religious sites was key to demoralizing the nation and
          community. Foreign conquerors razed temples in India repeatedly for
          this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demolishing Ram temple in Ayodhya had the same motive of subjugating
          India by weakening society, he stated. However the strategy did not
          succeed. Faith, commitment and morale of Indians never diminished.
          Resistance continued. Repeated attempts were made to regain the
          birthplace and rebuild the temple, through many wars and sacrifices.
          The Ram Janmabhoomi issue remained etched in Hindu minds, Bhagwat
          emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recalling that Hindus and Muslims jointly fought the British in 1857,
          he said there was a chance for reconciliation by banning cow slaughter
          and freeing Ram&apos;s birthplace. Bahadur Shah Zafar guaranteed a cow
          slaughter ban, uniting society against the British. Though the war
          failed, the temple struggle persisted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagwat recounted that Ram&apos;s idol appeared at the site in 1949.
          The temple was unlocked by court order in 1986. The Hindu
          society&apos;s campaigns and efforts went on, culminating in the
          balanced Supreme Court verdict of 2019 after 134 years of legal
          battle. Now, on January 22nd, the installation ceremony will be held,
          he stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temple marks the revival of national pride and modern society
          accepting Ram&apos;s values, he said. Bhagwat urged adopting
          Ram&apos;s virtues - integrity, bravery with forgiveness, sincerity,
          humility, compassion, duty focussed strictness. This will require
          honest hard work from all.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the RSS chief hailed the temple while calling for communal
          harmony, saying Ram embodied virtues that all should imbibe. He
          recounted the history of temple struggles and court battles. The
          consecration marks cultural reawakening and upholding values,
          according to him.

          Less than 48 hours before the scheduled consecration on January 22nd,
          an elaborate set of rituals involving the new 51-inch idol of Ram
          Lalla were completed on Saturday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eyes of the new idol, still covered in cloth, underwent various
          &quot;adhivas&quot; rituals which involved draping the entire frame
          with a variety of flowers brought from across India including Tamil
          Nadu, Maharashtra and Kolkata, according to sources involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          These flowers, estimated at 50 kg, included lotus, rose, jasmine and
          chrysanthemum.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a 3 hour ritual called &quot;snapan&quot;, the inner sanctum was
          also washed with water from 81 &quot;Kalash&quot; or urns sourced from
          various religious sites and rivers across India, including Sitamarhi
          in Bihar and Nepal, regarded as Sita&apos;s birthplace. Some urns
          contained medicated water with cow urine and juices of select fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for Monday, public viewing or &quot;darshan&quot; of
          the old Ram Lalla idol at the makeshift temple was halted. It will be
          moved to the inner sanctum on Sunday evening and its viewing is likely
          to resume from January 23rd along with that of the new idol, stated
          Satyendra Das, priest of Ram Lalla.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rituals on Sunday included &quot;Shakradhivas&quot;,
          &quot;Phaladhivas&quot; and &quot;Pushpadhivas&quot;, offering the
          idol sugar and sweets, fruits and then flowers respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the ritual fire ceremony that began on Friday continued
          into the evening around the mandap, about 100 meters from the temple
          site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, elaborate rituals were completed around the new Ram Lalla
          idol less than 48 hours before its consecration. Public viewing of the
          old idol was stopped in preparation for installing the new idol on
          January 22nd. The rituals involved bathing, as well as offerings of
          flowers, fruits and sweets to the deity.

          The day following the December 21st terrorist attack on an army convoy
          in Poonch, where four soldiers lost their lives, reports have emerged
          of alleged detention and torture of civilians by security personnel.

          five civilians from the same village have claimed they endured torture
          and unlawful detention as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incidents occurred despite assurances of justice by high ranking
          officials like Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Army Chief Manoj
          Pande during visits to the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is understood that the Jammu and Kashmir police have requested the
          army to furnish medical documents concerning the five hospitalized men
          - Riaz (25) and his brother Farooq (19), along with Israel (20),
          Jameel (18) and Irfan (18). A senior police officer stated that the
          records are required to produce the victims before a judicial
          magistrate and document their statements, as part of the investigation
          into the deaths. The five men are considered eyewitnesses, as they
          were reportedly detained alongside the deceased.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wazir Hussain, father of Riaz and Farooq, revealed that his family
          received Rs 2.5 lakhs in compensation for each son – Rs 1 lakh from
          the civil administration and Rs 1.5 lakhs from the army when they were
          discharged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mehmood Bhat, the former village head of Topa Pir, corroborated that
          he assisted the families in obtaining compensation cheques from the
          authorities. The army spokesperson declined to comment regarding the
          five hospitalized men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ambush of army vehicles occurred between Dehra Ki Gali and Bufliaz
          on the Mughal road. The following morning, eight civilians were
          allegedly detained from Topa Pir in the Bufliaz area of Poonch
          district, along with five more from Thanamandi in Rajouri district.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of the eight people from Topa Pir, three – Shabir Ahmed (30), Safeer
          Ahmed (45) and Mohammad Showkat (22) – passed away due to injuries
          purportedly sustained from torture. After pleas from locals that the
          others would die without medical intervention, they were admitted to a
          hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to reports, Israel, one of the five detainees from Topa Pir,
          claimed he received a summons to report to an army post around 11:30
          am on December 22nd. He alleged being stripped and beaten with batons
          and iron rods until losing consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Israel stated that Showkat, Shabir, Safeer and Riaz were already
          detained at the camp, while Farooq, Jameel and Irfan were brought in
          later. “We were dragged outside and revived with water before more
          torture,” he recounted, adding they were finally moved to an army
          facility where he regained consciousness that night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like the others, Israel maintained he was given Rs 1 lakh by the
          Poonch District Collector and Rs 1.5 lakhs by the army upon discharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wazir Hussain alleged his sons’ skin had darkened from the abuse. He
          said he bought them new clothes and shoes in Surankote since they had
          been stripped prior to the ill-treatment and lacked garments when
          hospitalized. &quot;Their current attire was donated by others,&quot;
          he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 27th, Defense Minister Singh and Army Chief General Pande
          visited Rajouri district and met with the families of the deceased
          civilians. As per the bereaved, the Minister promised justice would be
          served.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, addressing troops, Singh remarked that along with defending the
          nation, they also shoulder the huge responsibility of winning the
          hearts of countrymen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rajnath had additionally interacted with the five detainees from
          Thanamandi at the Government Medical College, Rajouri. Discharged
          between January 2nd and 6th, they were identified as Mohammad Ashraf
          (52), Farooq Ahmed (45), Fazal Hussain (50) and his nephews Mohammad
          Betab (25) and a 15-year-old. Each received Rs 3 lakhs in
          compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The J&K administration announced Rs 20 lakhs in compensation for
          families of the deceased, along with a land parcel and government job
          for one member. The army provided Rs 10 lakhs ex-gratia.

        <p>
          The Indian Embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has invited
          Badruddin Haqqani, the envoy for the Taliban, to attend the Republic
          Day celebrations in Abu Dhabi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Badruddin Haqqani, one of the sons of Jalaluddin Haqqani, was
          appointed as Ambassador in October 2023. His brother, Sirajuddin
          Haqqani, serves as the Interior Minister of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Haqqani network, comprised of prominent Taliban leaders, was
          involved in several terrorist attacks including the 2008 attack on the
          Indian Embassy in Kabul.
        </p>
        <p>
          A copy of the invitation, issued by Indian Ambassador to UAE Sunjay
          Sudhir, was shared on Twitter by Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary, now
          based outside of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          New Delhi&apos;s perspective is that the Indian government has been
          engaging with the Taliban since it sent a technical team and reopened
          the Indian Embassy in Kabul. Thus, inviting Badruddin Haqqani aligns
          with that approach, sources said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources said the invitation was addressed to the envoy of the
          &quot;Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.&quot; The Taliban refers to
          itself as the &quot;Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan;&quot; the
          &quot;Islamic Republic of Afghanistan&quot; was represented by former
          President Ashraf Ghani.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carefully navigating the issue, India has been engaging with the
          Taliban in Kabul but has not yet granted diplomatic recognition to the
          Taliban regime. The Indian government is following the template of the
          international community - engaging with the Taliban without officially
          recognizing them per UN standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afghanistan&apos;s Consuls General in Mumbai and Hyderabad announced
          in November 2022 that they would keep the Afghan Embassy in New Delhi
          open and operational – its closure was announced by Farid Mamundzay,
          the ousted government’s Ambassador to India, who termed the Consuls
          General as Taliban representatives. Given this, India is examining
          three key indicators that do not amount to India&apos;s de facto
          recognition of the Taliban regime:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the new leadership will continue flying the Islamic Republic of
          Afghanistan&apos;s tricolor flag, not the Taliban&apos;s white flag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the Embassy will retain the old name - the Islamic Republic of
          Afghanistan, instead of the Taliban’s Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, no new Taliban-appointed diplomats will join the Afghan Embassy
          in Delhi or the consulates in Mumbai and Hyderabad.

          Ahead of the grand opening ceremony for the new Ram Mandir in Ayodhya
          on January 22nd, special entry protocols have been outlined by the
          temple trust. Guests invited to the event will require more than just
          the physical invitation card for access to the temple complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trust clarified that attendees need to use a unique QR code to
          obtain a valid entry pass for the ceremony. Scanners will be set up at
          the pilgrimage facility to print the passes. Pre-registration through
          the online link sent to invitees along with their invitation, plus
          carrying an Aadhaar card, will be mandatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many elderly saints, seers and citizens may struggle with the online
          registration process. To assist them, the district administration has
          established help desks in coordination with the trust. Individuals
          arriving with just the physical invitation will be aided by volunteers
          at these help desks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The district administration is also verifying the credentials of all
          invitees upon their arrival in Ayodhya on or before January 22nd. This
          additional layer of authentication ensures smooth entry for approved
          guests on the day of the historic inauguration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, preparations are underway to welcome Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi to the city. Hoardings displaying central government
          schemes will line the Ram Path and Lucknow-Ayodhya highway. Around 300
          large hoardings will be installed between Sahadatganj and Lata Chowk
          to showcase flagship initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Saturday evening onwards, volunteers will begin decorating the
          Janmabhoomi Path. Ongoing civil works along the path will be halted
          from Saturday night onwards. The goal is completing all arrangements
          in time for the high-profile ceremony on January 22nd.
        </p>
        <p>
          The special security and access protocols demonstrate meticulous
          planning by the district administration to handle the large
          anticipated crowds. The QR code and online pre-registration
          requirements will facilitate organized entry of approved attendees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additional steps like credential verification and assistive help desks
          will ensure invited saintly figures and elderly guests are not
          inconvenienced. Smooth access for VIPs like the Prime Minister has
          also been planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          It underscores the significance of making this historic occasion
          seamless for all dignitaries as well as common devotees. With prudent
          advanced planning, the administration hopes to make the inauguration
          ceremony memorable and accessible for diverse attendees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The occasion carries huge spiritual and symbolic meaning for Hindus
          globally. The access protocols aim to uphold the sanctity and
          solemnity of this once-in-a-lifetime event at the new temple site in
          Ayodhya.

          Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik has announced his second marriage to
          Pakistani actor Sana Javed. The couple confirmed the news by posting
          photos on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Malik was previously married to Indian tennis star Sania Mirza. The
          former couple have a five-year-old son named Izhaan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Days before Malik&apos;s remarriage, Sania had shared a cryptic
          Instagram quote about divorce being difficult but necessary at times.
          It spoke about choosing your hardships wisely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sania and Malik married in 2010 and lived together in the UAE.
          Meanwhile, Sana Javed was earlier married to singer Umar Jaswal in
          2020 before separating in November 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Sania, the news comes after she retired last year from a stellar
          20-year professional tennis career. The trailblazing Indian player
          captured 43 WTA doubles titles and one singles title.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 37-year-old is renowned for six Grand Slam championships,
          including three women&apos;s doubles titles with Swiss great Martina
          Hingis. Sania also won two of her three mixed doubles Slams with
          fellow Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, and one with Bruno Soares.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, she began a new chapter as mentor for the Royal Challengers
          Bangalore franchise in the inaugural Women&apos;s Premier League. Her
          retirement cemented a legacy as one of India&apos;s greatest ever
          tennis athletes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Shoaib Malik continues plying his trade in T20 leagues
          globally. The veteran has not yet retired from cricket&apos;s shortest
          format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sania&apos;s enigmatic social media post indicates the dissolution of
          her high-profile relationship with Malik. Her oblique reference to the
          difficulties of divorce shows the personal challenges during this new
          phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          For both sports stars, intense media glare has long accompanied their
          careers. This latest development will draw its own share of fevered
          speculation around the reasons for their split after 12 years of
          marriage.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, their primary focus will be navigating this transition
          sensitively while protecting their young son&apos;s wellbeing. For
          Sania, who has broken barriers for female athletes, new possibilities
          may unfold after a monumental tennis career.
        </p>
        <p>
          She can reflect proudly on her trailblazing achievements on and off
          the court. This next chapter will reveal how she approaches
          life&apos;s complex hurdles with the same champion&apos;s resilience

          Microsoft has revealed that the same elite Russian hacking group
          responsible for the massive SolarWinds breach in 2020-2021 has
          recently targeted the technology giant in a new cyber espionage
          operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a January 2024 blog post, Microsoft said the incursion by the
          notorious state-sponsored Russian group dubbed Midnight Blizzard began
          in late November 2022 and was detected on January 12th. Only a small
          subset of Microsoft corporate accounts were breached, with some emails
          and attachments stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the compromised accounts were members of Microsoft’s senior
          leadership and staff in cybersecurity, legal, and other key units.
          Microsoft’s threat research team attributed the attack without doubt
          to Midnight Blizzard, known by researchers as APT29, Nobelium, or Cozy
          Bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team determined the primary motive was to gain intelligence on
          what Microsoft knew about the group&apos;s past and ongoing
          activities. The initial entry point was a “password spray attack” in
          November exploiting a Microsoft platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique involves trying a single compromised password across
          many related accounts to sneak into a target network. Microsoft stated
          no specific product or service vulnerability was exploited.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far there is no evidence the hackers accessed customer data,
          production systems, source code, or AI assets, the company emphasized.
          The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for
          comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Midnight Blizzard is linked to Russia&apos;s SVR foreign intelligence
          service according to U.S. officials. The elite hacker group is best
          known for infiltrating the Democratic National Committee before the
          2016 elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft software is ubiquitous across the U.S. government, and the
          company faced criticism last year when Chinese hackers stole senior
          State Department officials&apos; emails due to security practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before updating its threat naming in 2022, Microsoft called this same
          Russian group Nobelium. Cyber firm Mandiant dubs them Cozy Bear. In
          2021 Microsoft described the SolarWinds campaign as the most advanced
          nation-state cyberattack ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          It compromised over 100 private sector companies and government
          agencies in addition to US Justice and Treasury departments by
          hijacking widely-used network management software.
        </p>
        <p>
          This latest electronic intrusion highlights the constant threat posed
          by sophisticated, well-resourced nation-state hackers to all
          organizations according to Microsoft. It demonstrates Russia’s
          relentless drive to illegally acquire sensitive data for strategic
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the attack was detected and contained quickly, it underscores
          no entity is immune from targeting by groups like Midnight Blizzard
          with the backing of foreign governments. Continuous vigilance and
          proactive defense is required to protect institutional networks and
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft was specifically picked due to its visibility into
          cybersecurity threats and countermeasures. By understanding what and
          how much Microsoft knew about their past operations, the hackers could
          refine future tradecraft and targeting to avoid detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          This case illustrates the Spy vs. Spy nature of nation-state cyber
          espionage where major technology providers are both key targets and
          threats to avoid. It also shows no organization can afford to let its
          guard down against elite adversarial hacking given the stakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vigilance and resilience helped Microsoft detect and respond quickly
          to contain the latest Midnight Blizzard operation. But it remains a
          reminder that Russia-backed groups are actively looking to penetrate
          private and public sector networks to fulfill Kremlin intelligence
          priorities and agendas.

          The case of Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national accused by American
          authorities of involvement in a failed assassination plot, has taken a
          new turn. Gupta was arrested in Prague last June and the United States
          is seeking his extradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Czech judicial authorities, the Prague High Court has
          ruled that the Czech Republic can legally extradite Gupta to the US to
          face charges there. This judgment upholds an earlier decision by a
          lower Czech court permitting extradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charges against Gupta were filed in November 2022 by federal
          prosecutors in New York. He is accused of conspiring with an Indian
          government employee to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a separatist Sikh
          nationalist living in the United States. Pannun holds dual American
          and Canadian citizenship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alleged assassination plot was uncovered and prevented from being
          carried out. Gupta has been detained in the Czech Republic since his
          arrest while awaiting the outcome of extradition proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following standard protocol, the Prague High Court&apos;s ruling will
          now be forwarded to the Czech Justice Ministry along with the full
          case file. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek will make the final
          determination on whether Gupta can be extradited to America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minister Blažek could potentially have doubts about the high
          court&apos;s decision, in which case he can ask the Supreme Court to
          review the matter within three months. But the timeframe for a final
          extradition decision remains uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a spokesperson, the requested person, Gupta, can be
          expected to exploit all available legal means to halt the extradition
          process. Earlier, Gupta&apos;s defense lawyer filed an appeal
          contesting his client&apos;s identity and arguing the case is
          politically motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The appeals court has now rejected that appeal, clearing the path for
          the justice minister to approve the extradition request. Gupta&apos;s
          attorney has suggested they may take the case to the Constitutional
          Court as a last resort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, the defense lawyer alleged human rights violations against
          Gupta in Czech custody, including extended solitary confinement. Court
          documents filed in January claimed Gupta was last in the United States
          in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          American authorities, however, believe Gupta worked with an Indian
          government employee to hatch the failed plot against Pannun sometime
          before his arrest last summer. The indictment alleges they conspired
          to kill Pannun on US soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case has generated interest given the intrigue surrounding the
          transnational assassination plot and the involvement of intelligence
          agencies. Gupta&apos;s ultimate fate now lies in the hands of Czech
          judicial authorities who will decide if the evidence merits
          extraditing him to stand trial in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          This new development marks the latest twist in an ongoing legal saga
          playing out across multiple countries. The final chapter remains
          uncertain, but progress has been made towards potentially extraditing
          Gupta to face charges relating to the alleged murder conspiracy.

          The partial shutdown of one of the world&apos;s busiest airports is an
          annual measure taken amid heightened security prior to R-Day
          celebrations. Coming after weeks of fog-related flight delays,

          R-Day celebrates India&apos;s democratic spirit amidst tightened
          security and restrictions. But citizens must retain liberty, mobility
          and convenience to the extent possible rather than be subjected to
          overzealous curtailments each year. Collaborative measures between
          security forces, airports and airlines can enhance safeguards while
          ensuring smooth operations and services.

          The idol of Lord Ram was installed in Ayodhya&apos;s Ram Temple on
          Thursday, in preparation for the consecration ceremony on Monday,
          January 23rd.

          The first image of the idol shared by Union Minister Shobha Karandlaje
          depicts Lord Ram as a 5-year-old child standing upright. Sculpted by
          Mysuru-based artist Arun Yogiraj, the black stone idol measures 51
          inches tall.

          Chants and prayers filled the air as the Ram Lalla idol was
          respectfully placed in the inner sanctum. Consecration rituals
          commenced on January 12th. Sources say PM Modi will perform the Pran
          Pratishtha puja on the 23rd to complete the consecration rites.
        </p>
        <p>
          A team of priests led by Lakshmikant Dixit will perform the main Pran
          Pratishtha rituals. PM Modi is strictly adhering to prescribed rules
          ahead of his participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources share that the PM is sleeping on the floor with just a
          blanket, only drinking coconut water. He has asked the public not to
          visit Ayodhya on the 22nd to avoid inconveniencing Lord Ram,
          suggesting they come from the 23rd onwards instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          PM Modi also called on every Indian household to light a diya on
          January 22nd to be part of the ceremony spiritually. Over 11,000
          specially invited guests from India and abroad will physically attend
          the momentous event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idol&apos;s installation marks a key milestone in the
          temple&apos;s construction. The consecration rites will imbue the
          deity with divine presence. PM Modi&apos;s observance of preparatory
          rituals reflects his commitment to tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          His appeal to celebrate nationally with diyas rather than crowding
          Ayodhya demonstrates thoughtful leadership upholding Lord Ram&apos;s
          ideals. The grand temple&apos;s consecration will be a historic
          moment, fulfilling devotees&apos; centuries-long wait to offer worship
          there.

          Last week, the Hyderabad police made a major bust by arresting Rakesh
          Jain and Mahaveer Jain for illegally manufacturing and selling
          counterfeit Mysore Sandal soaps. This fraudulent operation had been
          running for nearly a decade across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and the
          Hyderabad-Karnataka region, causing estimated losses of Rs 500-600
          crore to the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL) - the
          legitimate producer of Mysore Sandal soap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tip-off came from an anonymous message received by Karnataka
          Industries Minister M B Patil, who also chairs the KSDL. Acting on
          this lead, KSDL staff in Secunderabad purchased over Rs 5 lakh worth
          of fake soaps for testing, proving they were counterfeit. However,
          details on the manufacturers remained scant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cunning plan was hatched - a large Rs 25 lakh order was placed for
          the fake soaps as a pretense for visiting the secret manufacturing
          facility. This enabled the perpetrators to finally be identified and
          arrested. Investigations suggest the counterfeit operation
          specifically targeted religious events and tourist destinations where
          buyers may be less discerning about product authenticity. With
          estimated annual turnover of Rs 60 crore, it was a highly lucrative
          business built on deceit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scam worked by offering retailers substantially higher commissions
          than the genuine product, creating strong financial incentives to
          peddle the fake soaps. A 75g bar of real Mysore Sandal soap earns
          retailers minimal margin, but the counterfeits were sold at less than
          half price, generating huge profits. Similarly, boxes of 3 x 450g
          genuine soaps provide Rs 10 margin, but the fakes offered Rs 50 - a
          five-fold increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lab tests by KSDL revealed the counterfeit soaps contained dangerous
          heavy metals that could cause cancer. Genuine boxes have holograms, so
          lack of this security feature is a clear visual indicator of fakes.
          The criminals had exploited relaxed scrutiny of brands at religious
          fairs and festivals to pass off the hazardous products.
        </p>
        <p>
          A political angle also emerged, with allegations that the Jain
          brothers had links to local BJP leaders Manikant Rathod and Vittal
          Nayak. Photographs showing the accused with UP CM Yogi Adityanath and
          Telangana BJP MLA Raja Singh were revealed by Minister Priyank Kharge
          at a press conference. However, the BJP leaders strongly denied any
          connection to the crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, a KSDL corruption scandal surfaced last year when
          former BJP MLA and KSDL chairman Madal Virupakshappa&apos;s son
          Prashanth was caught collecting bribes for supply contracts. A raid on
          his premises uncovered a massive Rs 8.20 crore of unaccounted cash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent arrests prove more work is required to tackle the
          counterfeit trade which allows unscrupulous businesses to profit
          through deception and potentially harm public health. Tougher
          penalties and consumer education may help, but eliminating corrupt
          political connections will be key to effectively shutting down these
          dangerous fake networks for good.
