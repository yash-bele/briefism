        <p>
          The Supreme Court today raised concerns regarding the alleged verbal
          directive from the Tamil Nadu government to prohibit live broadcasts
          of the &apos;Pran Prathishta&apos; ceremony of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya in
          temples across the state. The court emphasized that the state
          government cannot impose such bans based on the argument that Hindus
          constitute a &quot;minority&quot; in certain regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the counsel representing the Tamil Nadu government, the
          bench, comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, asserted
          that the society is homogenous, and permissions for events should not
          be denied solely because of the presence of different communities in a
          particular area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressing disapproval of the alleged general order issued by the
          Tamil Nadu government, the bench labeled such directives as
          &quot;atrocious&quot; and instructed the state authorities not to
          summarily reject permission requests. The court emphasized the need
          for adherence to the law and highlighted that authorities should
          evaluate applications seeking permission for live telecasts and handle
          them in accordance with legal procedures. The court also insisted that
          if a request is denied, proper reasons must be provided for the
          rejection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu government and
          others in response to a plea filed by BJP&apos;s State Unit Secretary
          Vinoj P Selvam challenging the oral order that banned the live
          telecast of the &quot;Pran Prathishta&quot; ceremony of Ram Lalla in
          temples across the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the proceedings, the Tamil Nadu government asserted that there
          were no such restrictions, emphasizing that there was no ban on live
          telecasts, poojas, archanas, annadhanas, or bhajans during the
          &quot;Pran Prathishta&quot; ceremony of Lord Ram at Ayodhya. The
          government argued that the plea was politically motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Senior counsel Dama Seshadri Naidu, representing the petitioner,
          argued that certain police orders had imposed a ban on live-streaming
          and other religious activities related to the ceremony at
          Ayodhya&apos;s Ram Janmabhoomi Temple. He contended that the orders
          were driven by political motives, alleging a disdain for religion by
          the ruling party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, representing the Central
          government, expressed shock at the situation and urged the Supreme
          Court to send a strong message to the state government. He emphasized
          that the Constitution of India governs the nation, including the state
          of Tamil Nadu, and stated that religious rituals should not be
          obstructed. Mr. Mehta pointed out that LED screenings in temples were
          being halted in the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bench sought clarification from the Tamil Nadu government
          regarding the reasons behind the ban and expressed displeasure upon
          reviewing the orders presented by the petitioner&apos;s counsel.
          Justice Datta criticized the notion that denials were based on the
          minority status of certain communities in the requested locations,
          stating that such reasons were &quot;atrocious&quot; and suggested
          that, if followed, they would prevent any procession or ritual across
          the state.
        </p>
        <p>The matter has been scheduled for further hearing on January 29.</p>

          Former cricket stars Virender Sehwag and Shoaib Akhtar entertained
          fans with their hilarious banter in a recent social media post. Akhtar
          shared a video where Sehwag poked fun at the pace legend&apos;s
          famously long run-up.{" "}

          Despite being rivals on the field, the two share great camaraderie off
          it. &quot;My dear friend Viru @virendersehwag saying how my long
          run-up used to make him wait and distract him,&quot; Akhtar captioned
          the post.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video, Sehwag says he would keep looking down knowing it took
          Akhtar 10-15 seconds to finish his run-up. When asked if it was
          distracting, Sehwag quipped that many thoughts would run through his
          mind - &quot;Will he hit my toes or beamer on my head or hit me
          somewhere else?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sehwag retired as one of India&apos;s most prolific batters with 8,586
          Test runs at a stellar average of 49.34 from 104 matches. He amassed
          8,273 ODI runs from 251 games with a strike rate of 104.33. In 19
          T20Is, he scored 394 runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Akhtar played 46 Tests taking 178 wickets at 25.69. In 163 ODIs, he
          claimed 247 wickets at 24.97 average. He also took 19 wickets in 15
          T20Is for Pakistan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The lighthearted social media exchange gave fans a glimpse of
          Sehwag&apos;s famed wit and sense of humor. It also highlighted the
          warm ties between the two legends who were fierce competitors on the
          field.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Their relaxed banter proves that sportsmanship and camaraderie can
          thrive between rivals beyond retirement. Moments like these are a
          reminder of cricket&apos;s unique power to bridge divides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans thoroughly enjoyed this mirthful interaction laced with mutual
          respect. Veterans regaling viewers with their anecdotes always makes
          for entertaining content. Akhtar and Sehwag continue to keep their

          CCTV footage showed the two men entering the store while the manager
          walked behind with a mop bucket. The men browsed aisles before one
          concealed a bag of chips in his pants. They left without paying after
          several minutes.{" "}

          The clerk then confronted them outside before getting in his car to
          follow as they walked away. Humble Assistant Police Chief Dan Zientek
          said the victim tried reversing his car when the men began shooting,
          but ended up struck on the median.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 42-year-old was hit by a bullet while in the driver&apos;s seat.
          His car had bullet holes in the windshield and rear window. The
          culprits fled on foot and remain at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chief Zientek lamented the tragic loss of an innocent man &quot;just
          trying to work and do their job.&quot; He said the shooters had also
          ruined their own lives and would face jail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The senseless killing over something as trivial as a bag of chips has
          shocked the local community. It underscores the perils of retail work
          in a country awash with guns and gun violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Store employees trying to stop petty thefts should not have to fear
          for their lives. While chasing the shoplifters was ill-advised, it did
          not warrant a death sentence on the spot without trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The culprits must be swiftly brought to justice to send a strong
          message that such trigger-happy violence will not be tolerated. Beyond
          that, there needs to be sensible reform to prevent such needless
          tragedies recurring.

          The remark alluded to the BJP&apos;s attacks comparing Congress to the
          demon king Ravan after its top leaders declined invites. Sarma added
          that after 500 years, this was a good day to talk of Lord Ram and not
          Ravan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rahul Gandhi did not receive an invite to the consecration event led
          by PM Modi in Ayodhya. Instead, invites went to Congress president
          Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi and parliamentary leader Adhir Ranjan
          Chowdhury, who declined citing politicization ahead of elections.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, Rahul had termed it a &quot;Narendra Modi function&quot;
          organized by the BJP and RSS. He said it was difficult for Congress to
          attend what was a political event designed around the PM and RSS. This
          drew sharp criticism from BJP leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The BJP has been slamming those who declined the invite as
          &apos;anti-Hindu&apos; and said the people will punish them
          electorally. Sarma&apos;s remark continues that narrative on the day
          of the historic ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Congress has maintained it respects the significance of the
          temple but cannot partake in what it sees as an event hijacked for
          political gains. Rahul claimed the function was organized around PM
          Modi, not Lord Ram.
        </p>
        <p>
          The war of words underscores how religious events have also become
          political battlegrounds. Both sides are seeking to claim the legacy of
          Ayodhya.
        </p>
        <p>
          But beyond the politics, this historic moment has deep cultural and
          spiritual resonance for millions of Hindus worldwide. The consecration
          ceremonies mark the culmination of a long and emotional journey for
          Ram devotees.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The attendance of top dignitaries signifies Ayodhya&apos;s restoration
          as a preeminent place of faith and pilgrimage. However, keeping the
          sanctity of the occasion should take priority over scoring political
          points.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this auspicious occasion, reconciliation rather than recrimination
          can better heal past divides. The temple carries a universal message
          of unity and justice that transcends any single ideology or party.

          A new ancient cat species dubbed Magerifelis peignei has been
          identified after its fossilized remains were discovered in Madrid,
          Spain. The small feline lived approximately 15.5 million years ago
          during the Middle Miocene epoch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lead author Dr. Manuel Salesa and colleagues from the National Museum
          of Natural Sciences-CSIC announced the findings. Magerifelis belonged
          to the Felinae subfamily, possessing a bony hyoid that allowed purring
          but not roaring.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The exceptionally well-preserved fossils were found at the Principe
          Pio-2 site in 2007. They comprised a nearly complete lower jaw with
          most teeth intact except the incisors. This remarkable specimen
          provides valuable insights into the paleoecology of these primitive
          cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;We recovered a practically complete jaw that preserved almost
          all of its teeth in exceptional condition,&quot; said co-author Dr.
          Siliceo. Uniquely, it had a tiny lower second molar absent in all
          living and extinct felids except Proailurus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magerifelis is estimated to have weighed around 7.6 kg, comparable to
          female modern lynx, servals and caracals. Comparison of its lower jaw
          shows it was larger than today&apos;s wildcats but smaller than lynx
          species when adjusted for mandibular length.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          However, its teeth were smaller than modern counterparts of similar
          jaw size. This indicates a more robust build with a relatively higher
          jaw, similar to the much larger Eurasian lynx.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the researchers, this powerful bite force would have
          enabled Magerifelis to potentially hunt relatively large prey compared
          to its size. Dentition analysis suggests its diet included small
          mammals, reptiles, birds and insects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other Miocene cat fossils have been found across Eurasia and Africa.
          But Magerifelis provides the first clear evidence of primitive felids
          in the Iberian Peninsula. The discovery sheds new light on cat
          evolution and dispersion during the Middle Miocene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysis shows it was an agile tree-climber well-adapted to mixed
          habitats of forests, wetlands and open spaces. As an early felid, it
          represents a pivotal transitional stage between the extinct
          Pseudaelurus and modern cats like lynxes and wildcats.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The serendipitous urban discovery highlights the scientific value of
          fossil sites even in busy city settings. The researchers say further
          excavation could uncover more Magerifelis remains and offer deeper
          insight into primitive cats.

              seven people in Half Moon Bay.

          &quot;Jill and I pray for the families of the victims,&quot; Biden
          wrote in a Twitter thread, marking the painful anniversary.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          He noted that in the aftermath, he had announced executive actions to
          address America&apos;s gun violence epidemic. This included launching
          the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention and
          implementing the bipartisan Safer Communities Act.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden urged Congress to take further steps like banning assault
          weapons and high-capacity magazines, removing liability protections
          for gun manufacturers, enacting red flag laws, mandating universal
          background checks and safe storage requirements.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In an extended statement from the White House, Biden recalled how the
          back-to-back shootings had &quot;shocked the conscience of our
          nation.&quot; He highlighted honoring the heroism of Brandon Tsay, who
          disarmed the Monterey Park shooter, during his State of the Union
          address.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden also noted his visit to grieving families in Monterey Park and
          his new executive actions on gun reform announced there.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          He praised California&apos;s response, including passing over 20 new
          gun laws and investing in violence intervention programs. Biden urged
          other states to follow this example.
        </p>
        <p>
          The statement underscores that a year on, the wounds from the
          unconscionable loss of life remain fresh. While executive actions and
          state laws reflect progress, the need for congressional action on gun
          safety remains urgent.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay families deserve to see real
          change emerge from their anguish. Only by working together across all
          levels of government can the scourge of gun violence be meaningfully
          addressed, as Biden reiterated on this solemn anniversary.

          President Biden recently mocked former President Donald Trump on X for
          mixing up Nikki Haley and Nancy Pelosi during a speech. Biden posted a
          video highlighting Haley&apos;s comments at a January 20th rally and
          Trump&apos;s speech the day before where he erroneously named Haley
          instead of Pelosi.{" "}

          &quot;Last night, Trump is at a rally going on and on about me but got
          confused and said he was running against Obama. He never ran against
          Obama. Don&apos;t put our country at risk like this,&quot; Haley is
          heard saying in Biden&apos;s video.{" "}

          &quot;I don&apos;t agree with Nikki Haley on everything, but we agree
          on this much: She is not Nancy Pelosi,&quot; Biden captioned the
          snippet.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Trump&apos;s gaffe, Haley took a dig at his mental fitness at a
          Keene rally, saying &quot;We can&apos;t have someone else that we
          question whether they&apos;re mentally fit to do this.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump, however, claimed at a Manchester rally that he &quot;aced&quot;
          a cognitive test, boasting &quot;I feel my mind is stronger now than
          it was 25 years ago. Is that possible?&quot;{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The test Trump referred to is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
          administered in 2018 by then-White House physician Ronny Jackson. It
          screens for mild cognitive issues. At the time, Jackson said Trump
          scored 30/30 and was &quot;mentally very sharp, very intact.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The video exchange underscores the debate around Trump&apos;s mental
          acuity as he mounts another presidential bid. While supporters insist
          he remains as sharp as ever, critics have consistently questioned if
          he&apos;s shown signs of decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden seems eager to stoke doubts by highlighting Trump&apos;s
          occasional confused statements. But weaponizing such gaffes for
          political attacks also risks ableism around age-related mental
          decline.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, fitness for the immense pressures of the presidency merits
          serious discussion. But any claims of impairment must be grounded in a
          non-partisan medical assessment rather than cherry-picked errors.
          Voters will soon render their verdict on whether Trump still possesses
          the judgment to potentially lead the country again.
