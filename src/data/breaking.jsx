          Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India&apos;s longest sea
          bridge, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri Nhava Sheva Atal Setu, also
          known as the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL), on Friday. The bridge
          is named after former Prime Minister and BJP veteran Atal Bihari
          Vajpayee.
        </p>
        <p>
          This bridge is set to revolutionize travel for Mumbaikars by reducing
          the two-hour journey from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai to just 20 minutes.
          Under construction for the past six years at a massive cost of around
          Rs 20,000 crores, the Atal Setu has been hailed as a boon for
          commuters.
        </p>
        <p>
          By spanning 22 km over the sea, the bridge drastically cuts down the
          travel distance between Sewri in South Mumbai and Chirle near Nhava
          Sheva in Navi Mumbai from 42 km to 22 km. This not only saves precious
          time but also promotes fuel conservation, addressing a pressing
          concern in busy Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touted as India&apos;s longest sea bridge, the project includes a 16.5
          km long section over the sea and a 5.5 km elevated stretch over land.
          As per officials, it has a design capacity of 70,000 vehicles daily,
          enabling smooth travel at 100 km/hr on average.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting at Sewri and ending at Chirle near Nhava Sheva, the Atal Setu
          offers key interchanges at Sewri, Shivajinagar, State Highway 54, and
          NH-348. This strategic connectivity significantly enhances local links
          while also establishing vital access to Pune, Goa and southern India,
          promoting regional integration.

          After nearly 8 years, the wreckage of an Indian Air Force An-32
          aircraft that went missing in 2016 has finally been discovered on the
          seabed of the Bay of Bengal. The plane, with registration number
          K-2743, had disappeared during a flight from Port Blair to Chennai on
          July 22, 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday, the Indian Air Force announced that debris from the crashed
          aircraft has been located at a depth of approximately 3.4 km, around
          310 km off the Chennai coast. The discovery was made by India&apos;s
          National Institute of Ocean Technology using specialized deep sea
          search equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          As per the IAF statement, NIOT recently deployed an advanced
          Autonomous Underwater Vehicle equipped with deep sea exploration
          capabilities to survey the aircraft&apos;s last known position.
          Multiple sensor payloads were utilized, including multi-beam sonar,
          synthetic aperture sonar and high-resolution photography. Analysis of
          the search imagery revealed the presence of aircraft debris on the
          seabed.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were 29 people on board the ill-fated An-32 transport plane that
          fateful day in 2016. After the plane went missing mid-flight, an
          extensive search and rescue operation was launched over the Bay of
          Bengal but no signs of the aircraft or passengers were found.
          Eventually all 29 were presumed dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent discovery of the wreckage thus provides some closure after
          years of the aircraft&apos;s mysterious disappearance. Efforts will
          now focus on attempting to retrieve the flight data recorder as well
          as any remains to aid the investigation into this tragic incident. The
          families of the lost passengers and crew will also get some answers to
          the enduring questions surrounding the crash.

          The U.S. and British militaries bombed over a dozen sites used by
          Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on Thursday. The massive
          retaliatory strike utilized warship and submarine missiles alongside
          fighter jets to target air defenses, drone and missile storage, and
          launching locations, officials said.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden stated the strikes demonstrated the U.S. and allies
          &quot;will not tolerate&quot; the militant group&apos;s relentless
          attacks on the Red Sea. Biden said they only acted after attempts at
          diplomacy and careful consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strikes directly responded to unprecedented Houthi attacks on
          international ships, including first-time use of anti-ship ballistic
          missiles, endangering personnel and trade, Biden explained. He added
          he will take further measures as needed to protect people and
          commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Yemen&apos;s capital Sanaa, journalists heard four explosions early
          Friday local time. Residents in the port city of Hodeida said they
          heard five strong blasts. Witnesses also reported strikes in cities
          south of Sanaa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinated assault marked the first U.S. military response to the
          Houthis&apos; persistent attacks on commercial vessels since the
          Israel-Hamas war began. It came just a week after the U.S. and
          partners warned the Houthis to stop or risk potential military action.
          The warning briefly deterred attacks before the rebels&apos;
          largest-ever drone and missile barrage on shipping Tuesday, prompting
          U.S. and British ships to shoot down missiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials said after Tuesday&apos;s attacks, Biden met with advisors
          and directed the retaliatory strikes. The UK confirmed its Royal Air
          Force took part, with fighters from Cyprus. Allied nations joined the
          U.S. and UK in saying they won&apos;t hesitate to defend lives and
          commerce, though the aim is de-escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis vowed retaliation, warning any attack will spark a fierce
          response beyond imagination. Houthi-run media described strikes
          hitting bases, airports and camps. Casualties remain unclear.
          Officials don&apos;t expect the strikes will eliminate Houthi
          capabilities but may prompt retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis say their attacks aim to stop Israel&apos;s war in Gaza.
          But their targets increasingly have little connection to Israel while
          imperiling a crucial Asia-Europe trade route. The UN Security Council
          passed a resolution Wednesday demanding the Houthis immediately halt
          attacks and implicitly condemned their Iranian weapons suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The broad coalition battling the Houthis shows the Biden
          administration&apos;s effort to avoid appearing unilateral. Multiple
          ships have already been struck despite a U.S.-led maritime mission to
          protect shipping. The U.S. long declined to signal when patience would
          run out before Wednesday&apos;s warning of consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reluctance reflected sensitivities about the shaky Yemen truce and
          worries about triggering wider regional conflict. But the
          attacks&apos; impact on shipping and escalation triggered the
          coalition warning. The strikes underscored using a united front rather
          than opening a new war front alone.

          A tragic incident occurred at the prestigious Indian Institute of
          Technology Kanpur (IIT-K) where an MTech student was found dead in his
          hostel room on Wednesday evening. According to police, the 26-year-old
          student, Vikas Kumar Meena, appeared to have died by suicide though
          further investigations are underway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vikas was enrolled in the Aerospace Engineering department at IIT-K
          and originally hailed from Meerut. After visiting the campus and
          speaking to faculty and students, Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner
          Akhil Kumar shared some preliminary findings though noted the probe is
          still ongoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stated that on Wednesday evening, Vikas&apos;s death in his hostel
          room was reported and at first glance, it seems to be a potential
          suicide case. However, only after a full post-mortem examination and
          further investigations can police definitively determine causes and
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police have obtained a digital copy of a purported suicide note which
          cites some academic issues that Vikas was facing. The note apparently
          claims no one else should be blamed for his actions. However,
          authorities are still working to verify the authenticity of the note
          and confirm it was written by Vikas before his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to investigating officials, some of Vikas&apos;s peers had
          gone to his locked hostel room after not getting any response to their
          knocks. When he still did not respond, institute officials were
          informed and the room&apos;s lock was broken, only to discover
          Vikas&apos;s body hanging inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking to media, Vikas&apos;s father Anil Kumar Meena revealed his
          son had grown depressed after recently receiving an academic
          termination notice from IIT-K which he could not timely appeal
          against. Anil claims Vikas felt he could have gotten the notice
          repealed if granted the appeal opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police are still holding on to Vikas&apos;s mobile phone and the
          alleged suicide note. Anil described his son as a very friendly person
          and believes the termination notice directly led to his suicide due to
          resulting depression.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, IIT-K officials clarified that such termination warning
          letters are meant to prompt students to meet with faculty and address
          their issues, and can be easily challenged to get revoked. But Vikas
          apparently did not take these steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its statement, IIT-K called Vikas an academically bright student
          who joined the MTech program in 2021. Losing him is a major loss for
          the institute and his passing is deeply upsetting, the statement
          added. Kanpur&apos;s Police Commissioner also mentioned having
          discussions with IIT-K&apos;s Director to ascertain the full
          circumstances and consider corrective actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The investigation into Vikas&apos;s tragic death remains ongoing as
          police work to conclusively determine the causes and events leading up
          to the suspected suicide. His family, friends and the IIT-K community
          are grieving the devastating loss of a promising young student and
          individual.

          An Ohio woman who was criminally charged for allegedly mishandling a
          home miscarriage will not be indicted, a grand jury decided on
          Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor&apos;s office in Trumbull County said the grand jury
          declined to charge Brittany Watts, 34, of Warren with abuse of a
          corpse. This resolved a controversial case that drew national
          attention for its implications for pregnant women as states enact new
          laws on reproductive healthcare access post - Roe v. Wade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision came just before around 150 supporters gathered for a
          rally supporting Watts in Warren&apos;s Courthouse Square. Watts
          addressed the crowd, thanking her community and declaring she will
          continue fighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watts&apos; attorney said an outpouring of public support helped her
          client endure being charged with a felony. The lawyer stated that
          despite how upsetting it sounds, Watts&apos; experience reflects the
          sad reality of miscarriage. They expressed relief and gratitude that
          the grand jury reached a just decision today.
        </p>
        <p>
          A municipal judge previously found probable cause against Watts.
          Prosecutors alleged she miscarried into a toilet, removed contents to
          outdoor trash, and left the 22-week fetus lodged in pipes. Records
          show her doctor advised hospital induction due to nonviable pregnancy
          and serious risks. But complications and delays prevented treatment.
          After miscarrying at home, she unsuccessfully tried going to a hair
          appointment before friends insisted she go to the hospital. A
          nurse&apos;s 911 call spurred the ensuing investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor argued the issue was not how or when the fetus died,
          but that Watts discarded it in the toilet, clogging it, and went about
          her day. An autopsy found the fetus died in utero with no recent
          injuries. Watts&apos; lawyer contended she had no criminal record and
          was being vilified for a common occurrence. The lawyer also questioned
          whether the abuse-of-corpse statute clearly defined terms like
          &quot;corpse&quot; and &quot;outrage&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          After binding the case over, the judge acknowledged better scholars
          should determine the fetus&apos;s precise legal status. Now, the
          prosecutor says further investigation found Watts committed no crime,
          despite disagreeing with the lower court&apos;s law application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advocates expressed relief at the outcome, but warned Watts&apos; case
          exemplifies the threats Black women face for pregnancy outcomes amid
          abortion restrictions. They called for ending the criminalization of
          reproductive outcomes, which undermines rights and deters necessary
          care. Watts hopes her experience prompts change through education and
          legislation so no other woman endures similar trauma fighting for
          freedom.

          social media. When Shoaib arrived in Turbhe on January 8th to
          celebrate Kaur&apos;s birthday, what appeared to be a blossoming
          romance took a dark turn.

          Based on the details given by the police, it appears that Shoaib
          killed Amit Kaur by strangulation in a lodge where they were
          celebrating, driven by feelings of suspicion and grief. Shoaib left
          the scene after carrying out the horrific deed, leaving the staff to
          discover the woman&apos;s lifeless body when they opened the door.

          Shoaib Sheikh was taken into custody by the Sakinaka police in Mumbai
          after they carried out an investigation. After being arrested, the
          young man—who worked in a garage—finally admitted to the crime.

          According to the police, Shoaib&apos;s misgivings about his lover
          ultimately motivated him to commit the murder. The victim, a
          well-liked bank manager, had no idea what evil plans had been
          simmering inside of Shoaib.

          The tragic event clarified the effects of a relationship poisoned by
          suspicion and deceit. The community was left reeling from the shocking
          reality that had descended upon them as the legal proceedings
          progressed and the dark secrets underlying this bizarre story of love
          and betrayal continued to come to light.

          When the vegetarian food offered to a woman traveling from Calicut to
          Mumbai on an Air India flight discovered pieces of chicken in it, she
          was taken aback.

          Later, Veera Jain shared the entire tale on X, a platform that was
          formerly Twitter. She also posted pictures of the food served to her
          by the airline.

          “On my @airindia flight AI582, I was served a veg meal with chicken
          pieces in it! I boarded the flight from Calicut airport. This was a
          flight that was supposed to take off at 18:40PM but left the airport
          at 19:40PM,” Veera Jain wrote.

          The word &quot;Veg&quot; is clearly visible on the wrapper of her food
          packet in the pictures she posted, but the chicken pieces inside are
          also irresistible. The woman continued to tweet &quot;When I told the
          cabin supervisor (Sona), she apologized and told me that there were
          other complaints about the same issue besides mine and my
          friend&apos;s. But nothing was done to let other passengers know that
          other people were eating vegetarian meals after I told the crew.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          She went on to say that she felt hurt and that she no longer trusted
          Air India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veera also appeared to be having trouble with the flight&apos;s
          takeoff delay. According to her, the AI582 flight was scheduled to
          depart at 6:40 p.m., but it was delayed by one hour. Her friend missed
          her train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad at 11 p.m. that night because of
          the delayed flight. At 8:40 p.m., the AI582 was supposed to touch down
          in Mumbai.

          Air India has not yet responded to this incident, so Jain urged the
          Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Indian Civil Aviation Authority
          (DGCA), and Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia to look into
          the situation.
