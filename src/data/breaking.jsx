          On the solemn one-year mark of the tragic Monterey Park mass shooting,
          President Joe Biden paid tribute to the 11 lives lost when a gunman

          A 72-year-old suspect, Huu Can Tran, unleashed the attack at the Star
          Dance Studio in Monterey Park before dying by suicide during a
          standoff with police in Torrance. Two days later, 67-year-old Chunli

              One year ago today, during Lunar New Year celebrations in Monterey

          &quot;Jill and I pray for the families of the victims,&quot; Biden
          wrote in a Twitter thread, marking the painful anniversary.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          He noted that in the aftermath, he had announced executive actions to
          address America&apos;s gun violence epidemic. This included launching
          the first-ever White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention and
          implementing the bipartisan Safer Communities Act.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden urged Congress to take further steps like banning assault
          weapons and high-capacity magazines, removing liability protections
          for gun manufacturers, enacting red flag laws, mandating universal
          background checks and safe storage requirements.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In an extended statement from the White House, Biden recalled how the
          back-to-back shootings had &quot;shocked the conscience of our
          nation.&quot; He highlighted honoring the heroism of Brandon Tsay, who
          disarmed the Monterey Park shooter, during his State of the Union
          address.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden also noted his visit to grieving families in Monterey Park and
          his new executive actions on gun reform announced there.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          He praised California&apos;s response, including passing over 20 new
          gun laws and investing in violence intervention programs. Biden urged
          other states to follow this example.
        </p>
        <p>
          The statement underscores that a year on, the wounds from the
          unconscionable loss of life remain fresh. While executive actions and
          state laws reflect progress, the need for congressional action on gun
          safety remains urgent.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay families deserve to see real
          change emerge from their anguish. Only by working together across all
          levels of government can the scourge of gun violence be meaningfully
          addressed, as Biden reiterated on this solemn anniversary.

          President Biden recently mocked former President Donald Trump on X for

          on this much: She is not Nancy Pelosi,&quot; Biden captioned the
          snippet.
        </p>
        <p>
          After Trump&apos;s gaffe, Haley took a dig at his mental fitness at a
          Keene rally, saying &quot;We can&apos;t have someone else that we
          question whether they&apos;re mentally fit to do this.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump, however, claimed at a Manchester rally that he &quot;aced&quot;
          a cognitive test, boasting &quot;I feel my mind is stronger now than
          it was 25 years ago. Is that possible?&quot;{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The test Trump referred to is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
          administered in 2018 by then-White House physician Ronny Jackson. It
          screens for mild cognitive issues. At the time, Jackson said Trump
          scored 30/30 and was &quot;mentally very sharp, very intact.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The video exchange underscores the debate around Trump&apos;s mental
          acuity as he mounts another presidential bid. While supporters insist
          he remains as sharp as ever, critics have consistently questioned if
          he&apos;s shown signs of decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden seems eager to stoke doubts by highlighting Trump&apos;s
          occasional confused statements. But weaponizing such gaffes for
          political attacks also risks ableism around age-related mental
          decline.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, fitness for the immense pressures of the presidency merits
          serious discussion. But any claims of impairment must be grounded in a
          non-partisan medical assessment rather than cherry-picked errors.
          Voters will soon render their verdict on whether Trump still possesses
          the judgment to potentially lead the country again.

          Staff Sergeant Michelle Young, a 34-year-old US Army soldier and
          popular fitness influencer with over 100,000 Instagram followers,
          tragically died by suicide recently just days after her
          daughter&apos;s 12th birthday.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Young had served in the army for 16 years after enlisting at age 18.
          She completed two demanding tours in Afghanistan during her
          distinguished military career.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the days prior to her death, Young had posted a heartwarming
          birthday message for her daughter, writing &quot;Happy birthday to the
          sweetest girl I&apos;ve ever known. The best part about my life is
          being your momma.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond her army service, Young was passionate about volunteering
          during her free time. She worked as a crisis and trauma response
          volunteer, drawing from her own grief after her brother&apos;s
          suicide. She also volunteered at a local women&apos;s and
          children&apos;s homeless shelter.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          On her Instagram, Young often modeled athletic apparel from a company
          focused on female veterans. She was a vocal advocate for improving
          mental health treatment for veterans struggling with trauma. The exact
          circumstances that led to her tragic suicide remain unclear.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Young shared an extremely close bond with her 12-year-old daughter
          Gracie. The two had recently dressed up together as NFL star Travis
          Kelce and singer Taylor Swift. Her latest birthday post shows no hint
          of the inner turmoil Young must have been facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A GoFundMe page has been launched following Young&apos;s passing to
          support her daughter&apos;s future. &quot;Michelle was a beautiful
          soul, an amazing friend, a single mother, a soldier, and is proof you
          never know what someone is going through or what demons they may be
          fighting,&quot; it states.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;NOTHING can replace her mother, but the purpose of this is to
          help her daughter Gracie with anything she may need. We know Michelle
          would appreciate us all looking out for her now,&quot; the campaign
          adds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staff Sergeant Young&apos;s tragic death is a reminder that even
          seemingly happy, accomplished people can be fighting inner battles
          without outward signs. Her loss is devastating, especially for her
          beloved daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          While her motivation remains unclear, her passing highlights the
          urgent need to provide better mental health support for veterans
          dealing with the aftereffects of trauma. If someone like Young can
          succumb to darkness, it shows much work remains to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As her friends said, Young was an inspiration to many. Honoring her
          memory means being proactive in checking on the wellbeing of veterans
          and offering help before it&apos;s too late. Preventing even one
          suicide would be the greatest tribute to her life of selfless service.

          A major part of the preparatory rituals that began on January 16th
          concluded on Sunday. The day started with the new 51-inch idol being
          covered with honey during the &apos;Madhvadhivas&apos; ritual. It was
          then bathed with medicated water from 114 urns as part of
          &apos;Snapan&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old idol was also taken around the new temple in a decorated
          palanquin before being brought inside. As the rituals continued into
          Sunday evening, the priests said the eyes of the new idol, which were
          closed on January 16th, will be opened after another purificatory
          bath. It will then be shown a mirror to absorb energies created by the
          rituals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ghee and honey will also be applied to the eyes with a gold stick. The
          old idol will be similarly bathed and both idols placed inside the
          sanctum sanctorum. The preparatory rituals ended with
          &apos;Shayandhivas&apos;, symbolically putting the idol to sleep after
          six days of worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quilts from Jaipur and a carved sheesham bed adorned the idol on
          Sunday night. On Monday morning, priests will arrive by 8:30 am to
          complete the remaining rites. The sacred fire will continue burning
          even after the ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consecration of the new Ram Lalla idol marks the fulfillment of a
          decades-old movement. The festivities reflect the devout fervor
          sweeping Ayodhya as this historic moment arrives after years of
          anticipation. PM Modi&apos;s attendance underscores its importance for
          the nation.

        <p>
          The committee, chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind, held its
          third meeting on January 22nd. It had invited public suggestions
          through a notice on January 5th, with a deadline of January 15th.
          Feedback was also collected via the committee&apos;s website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of 20,972 total responses, 81% supported the idea of simultaneous
          elections across the country. The committee had also sought inputs
          from 46 political parties, out of which 17 have submitted their
          suggestions so far. The Election Commission of India&apos;s views were
          also recorded.

          Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari, and former Delhi High Court
          Chief Justice G. Rohini. This was part of engaging with eminent
          jurists, ex-Supreme Court and High Court judges, past Chief Election
          Commissioners, and industry bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ministry stated that the committee will hold its next meeting on
          January 27th. The panel was set up last September by the Law Ministry
          and has held two previous meetings. Its mandate is to examine and
          recommend holding simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha, state
          assemblies, local bodies and panchayats.

          The move towards &apos;One Nation, One Election&apos; requires

          advocates argue it will cut election costs and provide policy
          continuity at the Centre and states.

        <p>
          With a majority of public responses in favor, the committee has a
          strong endorsement for deliberating further reforms. Its
          recommendations will be crucial to build political and public
          acceptance for simultaneous polls. But implementing One Nation, One
          Election will ultimately need Constitutional amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Law Ministry panel represents the government&apos;s most concrete
          step yet towards this long-pending electoral reform. Its consultative
          approach is welcome. Achieving simultaneous national and state
          elections will be challenging, but may strengthen governance in the
          long run if implemented judiciously.

          Home Minister Amit Shah chaired a key meeting in Raipur on Sunday to
          review the efforts to curb Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in Chhattisgarh.
          The objective is to eliminate the Maoist threat in the state within
          three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In attendance were the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Ministers, the
          Union Home Secretary, Intelligence Bureau Director, CRPF Director
          General, Chhattisgarh Chief Secretary, and the state police chief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah noted that joint efforts by central and state security forces
          have contained Maoist activities to some pockets. But a targeted plan
          is now needed to dismantle the entire support ecosystem of the rebels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Home Minister directed the state police to boost security, conduct
          thorough probes, closely monitor court cases, choke funding channels
          and continue intelligence-based operations. He stressed
          operationalizing all actionable inputs shared through the Multi-Agency
          Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah underlined the need to ensure complete coverage of central and
          state welfare schemes in Maoist-hit districts. He said the Home
          Ministry should allow flexibility in allotting and utilizing funds in
          these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Home Minister emphasized sensitively addressing all legitimate
          grievances of locals regarding entitlements. Following this, the Union
          Home Secretary interacted in detail with district police chiefs and
          administrators of the worst LWE-hit districts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-level meeting reflects the resolve to decisively end
          left-wing extremism in Chhattisgarh. The state has seen some of the
          deadliest Maoist attacks in the past decade despite sustained
          counter-insurgency efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah&apos;s emphasis on choking funding channels is critical as
          extortion remains a big source of income for Maoists. Strengthening
          local governance delivery will be equally important to wean away
          popular support from rebels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chhattisgarh police have the experience and motivation needed for the
          final push against extremists. Central assistance can plug gaps in
          resources and capabilities. But ultimately, the key will lie in
          granular, district-specific plans rooted in local realities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much progress has been made, but the last mile will be the toughest.
          Concerted action across multiple fronts in the coming years can help
          fulfill the Home Minister&apos;s vision of making Chhattisgarh
          Maoist-free. It will require political will, administrative
          coordination and security force professionalism.

          The eleven men convicted for the 2002 gang rape of Bilkis Bano and
          murder of her family members turned themselves in to authorities late
          Sunday night at the Godhra jail. This comes after the Supreme Court
          revoked the premature release granted to them by the Gujarat
          government on August 15th last year and ordered them to surrender
          within two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eleven men - Radheshyam Shah, Jaswant Nai, Govind Nai, Kesar
          Vohania, Baka Vohania, Raju Soni, Ramesh Chandana, Shailesh Bhatt,
          Bipin Joshi, Pradip Modhiya, and Mitesh Bhatt - arrived at the jail in
          Godhra from Singwad village in two separate vehicles shortly before
          midnight. Most came in a ten-seater van led by an SUV. The district
          police confirmed they had monitored and escorted the men into the
          jail.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for the surrender, police units were deployed outside
          the jail since Sunday evening. The jail authorities verified that the
          eleven men turned themselves in at 11:45pm on Sunday, just meeting the
          Supreme Court&apos;s stipulated deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes after the Supreme Court dismissed petitions from the men
          earlier last week asking for more time to surrender. They had cited
          reasons like caring for elderly parents, an upcoming wedding, and
          needing to harvest crops.
        </p>
        <p>
          On January 8th, the Supreme Court overturned the Gujarat
          government&apos;s decision to grant remission and release the men.
          They had been sentenced to life in prison for the rape of Bano and
          murder of her family members during the 2002 Gujarat riots. The Court
          ruled that the Gujarat government lacked the authority to grant
          remission, which should have been decided by the Maharashtra
          government.
        </p>
        <p>
          The men were originally released on August 15th under Gujarat&apos;s
          1992 remission policy based on a Supreme Court order in May 2022 in a
          petition filed by one of the convicts, Radheshyam Shah. Bano
          challenged the release, leading to the January 8th ruling reversing
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was raped by
          multiple men as she fled riot violence in 2002, which also claimed the
          lives of 14 of her family members including her three-year-old
          daughter. By ordering the men to surrender, the Supreme Court has
          provided a measure of justice to Bano after nearly two decades.
