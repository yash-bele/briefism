          Estranged from her husband, Suchana Seth, 39, is the chief executive
          officer of the artificial intelligence company Mindful AI Lab. It is
          alleged that Seth killed her four-year-old son in Goa and took the
          body to Karnataka.
        </p>
        <p>
          Superintendent of police (North) Nidhin Valsan stated at a press
          conference on Tuesday that Suchana Seth had informed the police that
          her husband and her were in the midst of divorce proceedings.

              Suchana Seth has been residing in Bengaluru, but she is originally
              from West Bengal.
            </li>
            <li>Kerala is the home of Venkat Raman, Seth&apos;s spouse.</li>
            <li>
              The divorced husband has been told about the incident and is
              presently in Jakarta, Indonesia.
            </li>
            <li>
              According to certain media reports, the couple got married in 2010
              and had a son in 2019.
            </li>
            <li>But in 2020, disagreements caused them to file for divorce.</li>
            <li>
              Pushing herself to the limit and wanting to keep Venkat Raman from
              seeing the boy, Seth allegedly made plans to take her child to
              Goa.

          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              Calangute police station inspector Paresh Naik stated that Suchana
              Seth and her son moved into a rented service apartment in
              Candolim, North Goa, on January 6.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following a few days of stay, Seth informed the apartment staff
              that she needed to go to Bengaluru for work and requested that
              they set up a taxi, according to Naik.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of hiring a taxi, which is an expensive option, the staff
              recommended that she take a flight to Bengaluru, which would be
              less expensive, the police officer said.
            </p>
            <p>
              The woman insisted that she would only take a taxi, and on January
              8 early in the morning, a car was arranged for her.
            </p>
            <p>
              He claimed that blood stains were discovered on a towel when the
              apartment staff went to clean the room where she had stayed later.
              The apartment&apos;s management notified the Calangute Police
              right away.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the staff reported to the police that Seth was seen
              carrying an abnormally heavy bag when she left the apartment and
              that her four-year-old son was not seen with her.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, she received a call from the police asking her about
              her missing son and the bloodstains.
            </p>
            <p>
              In response, the woman said that her monthly period was to blame
              for the bloodstains. She gave the address and mentioned that her
              son was in Margao town, South Goa, with her friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Naik, the police realized right away that the address
              she had provided was a fake after enlisting the assistance of the
              Fatorda Police (near Margao).
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, the taxi driver, who was traveling to Bengaluru and had
              arrived in the Karnataka district of Chitradurga, was instructed
              by the inspector over the phone to transport the accused person to
              the closest police station.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Naik, when the Chitradurga police examined the
              woman&apos;s bag, they discovered the child&apos;s body.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, a team from Calangute Police hurried to Chitradurga
              and secured the accused&apos;s transit remand so that he could be
              transported to Goa.

          Amidst the controversy surrounding a Maldivian minister&apos;s
          disparaging comments about Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Parliamentary
          Minority Leader Ali Azim of the Maldives demanded on Monday that
          Mohamed Muizzu, the president of the archipelago nation, be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noting that the foreign policy of the country remains stable, Azim
          called for a motion of no confidence to be put out against Muizzu.
        </p>
        <p>
          He asked in a post on X (previously Twitter), &quot;We, d Democrats, r
          dedicated to upholding d stability of the nation&apos;s foreign policy
          n preventing d isolation of any neighboring country. R u willing to
          take all necessary steps to remove prez @MMuizzu from power? Is
          @MDPSecretariat prepared to initiate a vote of no confidence?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          This follows a controversy that started when a few Maldivian
          politicians disparaged Prime Minister Modi and made fun of his most
          recent trip to Lakshadweep. India brought up the issue with Male in a
          strong manner, and the leaders of the island nation&apos;s opposition
          criticized the ruling class for the disagreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maldivian deputy minister of youth empowerment, Mariyam Shiuna,
          made a derogatory and mocking reference to Prime Minister Modi in a
          post that has since been removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comments incited a fierce backlash in India. The Maldives
          government rejected the disparaging remarks, claiming they did not
          reflect Male&apos;s opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three deputy ministers were also suspended by the Maldivian government
          on Sunday for disparaging remarks about Prime Minister Modi on social
          media. Ibrahim Khaleel, a spokesman for the Maldivian president,
          stated, &quot;All government officials responsible for the comments
          have been suspended from their post effective immediately.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the row, a number of well-known Indians, including cricketer
          Sachin Tendulkar, actor Akshay Kumar, actor Salman Khan, and actor
          Aakash Chopra, joined an online campaign advocating for a boycott of
          the Maldives and its tourist attractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amidst the boycott of the Maldives, online travel agency EaseMyTrip
          declared that &quot;country comes before business&quot; and that it
          would suspend all reservations for flights to the Maldives.
        </p>

          PM Modi visited the union territory on January 2 and posted a number
          of photos, including one of him snorkelling, which he described as a
          &quot;exhilarating experience.&quot; PM Modi posted images of the
          ocean, snow-white beaches, and clear blue skies on X, captioning them
          with the words, &quot;Lakshadweep has to be on your list for those who
          wish to embrace the adventurer in them.&quot;

          The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Kyiv was using missiles made in the
          West to attack Russian targets, but it declined to comment on claims
          made by the US and Ukraine that Moscow had fired North Korean missiles
          at targets in Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The White House announced last week that Russia had launched several
          strikes against Ukraine using short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs)
          that were obtained from North Korea, citing recently declassified
          intelligence. Later on, a senior Ukrainian official confirmed the
          report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the start of the conflict in Ukraine, both Moscow and Pyongyang
          have grown closer, despite their denials of having any arms deals. In
          September of last year, President Vladimir Putin and North Korean
          leader Kim Jong Un met in the Far East of Russia, and senior Russian
          officials have since visited Pyongyang multiple times.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about the allegations made by the United States and
          Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded, &quot;No
          comment&quot;, to a call with reporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peskov said that Ukraine had been using missiles made by
          &quot;Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and other
          countries&quot; to strike civilian targets inside Russia on multiple
          occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 30, an attack by Ukraine on the Russian border city of
          Belgorod resulted in the deaths of over 20 people, including two
          children, and 111 injuries, according to Russian media.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Belgorod region, which borders northern Ukraine, has experienced
          drone attacks and shelling this year, similar to other Russian border
          zones, which the authorities have attributed to Ukraine, though none
          had ever been this severe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stated goals of Moscow&apos;s Feb. 24, 2022, deployment of tens of
          thousands of troops into Ukraine were &quot;demilitarising&quot; and
          &quot;denazifying&quot; the nation. Moscow has stated that Western
          countries, including the US, are accountable for the fallout from
          arming Kyiv.
