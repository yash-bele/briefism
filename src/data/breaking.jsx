          The Bandra Kurla Complex police station has registered a First
          Information Report (FIR) against 41 owners of high-end cars, SUVs, and
          sports cars for conducting an unauthorized joyride and car rally on
          Republic Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car owners, primarily sons of prominent figures in the city&apos;s
          diamond, bullion, real estate, and share markets, residing in Napean
          Sea Road, Bandra, Khar, and Andheri, were charged by the police. The
          rally, featuring impounded vehicles such as Ferraris, Porsches,
          Lamborghinis, Mercedes cars, Audis, Jaguars, and BMWs, took place
          without obtaining the required permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to police sources, the rally, which had been an annual event
          for the past decade, was organized by an event and social media
          company. Scheduled to commence at 6 am from Jio World Drive Mall, BKC,
          with an anticipated participation of 100 cars, only half of them
          showed up. The plan was to traverse the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link
          (MTHL) and return to BKC.
        </p>
        <p>
          An alert about the rule violations was raised on social media platform
          X (formerly Twitter), prompting the police&apos;s social media team to
          inform senior officers. The BKC police station then intervened,
          questioning the car owners about permission, which they confirmed not
          having. Consequently, a case was registered against them under
          relevant sections for organizing a rally without permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 41 individuals, including college students, face charges under
          sections 188 (deliberate disobedience of a legally promulgated order
          by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and 135, 37(1), and
          37(3) of the Maharashtra Police Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, one of the car owners asserted that they had not
          commenced the rally and would have canceled the plan if the police had
          instructed them to do so due to the absence of permission. However, an
          FIR was lodged without heeding their explanation. The police are
          actively investigating the matter and obtaining details from the
          Regional Transport Office (RTO).

          On Tuesday, South Korea&apos;s military reported detecting North Korea
          conducting a series of cruise missile launches into the sea off its
          western coast, marking the third instance of such tests this month.
        </p>
        <p>
          These launches occurred amidst escalating tensions in the region,
          characterized by a heightened pace of both North Korea&apos;s weapon
          demonstrations and the United States&apos; joint military exercises
          with allies South Korea and Japan.

          South Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff announced that both South
          Korean and US forces were evaluating the launches. However, specific
          flight details, such as the number of missiles fired and their range,
          were not immediately disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
          These recent launches follow previous tests conducted on January 24
          and January 28, during which North Korea claimed to have tested a new
          cruise missile designed for submarine launches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, on January 14, North Korea tested a new solid-fuel
          intermediate-range missile, emphasizing its efforts to enhance its
          arsenal targeting remote US locations in the Pacific, including the
          strategic military base of Guam.

          A recently released FBI report reveals that approximately one in ten
          hate crimes in the United States occurs within educational
          institutions, spanning from kindergarten to college. The data,
          collected from 2018 to 2022, highlights schools as the third most
          common setting for hate crimes, following residences and roadways or
          alleys. Despite widespread closures during the 2020-2021 academic year
          due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools remained prominent locations for
          such incidents.
        </p>

          Black students emerged as the primary targets of hate crimes in
          educational settings, followed by victims from Jewish and LGBTQ
          communities. The surge in hate crimes across the country is evident in
          FBI records, with reported bias crimes increasing from about 8,500 in
          2018 to over 13,300 in 2022, reaching a record high.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of hate incidents reported within schools experienced an
          even more substantial spike, nearly doubling over the five-year
          period, rising from 700 in 2018 to 1,336 in 2022. Notably, this
          accounted for 10% of all reported hate crimes in the country, with
          almost two-thirds occurring in kindergarten-through-12th grade
          institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts caution that hate crimes are likely undercounted due to
          subjective evaluations by law enforcement agencies regarding
          discriminatory intent. Many victims opt not to report incidents to the
          police out of fear of reprisal. The rise in hate incidents is a
          concerning trend, reflecting broader societal challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, initiated by Hamas attacks on
          Israel in October, has contributed to a notable increase in both
          antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents across the United States, as
          reported by advocacy groups. This context underscores the
          interconnected nature of global events and their impact on hate crime
          trends within the country.

          In northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border, an unmanned aerial
          drone attack resulted in the death of three U.S. service members, with
          34 others sustaining injuries, as reported by President Joe Biden and
          U.S. officials on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden attributed the attack to Iran-backed groups, stating,
          &quot;While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know
          it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in
          Syria and Iraq.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          A U.S. official informed Reuters that at least 34 personnel were
          undergoing evaluation for possible traumatic brain injuries. Another
          official commented, &quot;While we’re still gathering facts, this is
          most assuredly the work of an Iranian-backed militia group.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          These casualties mark the first fatalities of U.S. troops in the
          region since the conflict in Gaza. President Biden revealed that the
          attack occurred on Saturday night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident significantly escalates the already tense situation in
          the Middle East, where conflict erupted in Gaza following an attack by
          the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, resulting in
          1,200 casualties. Israel&apos;s subsequent assault on Gaza has led to
          the death of over 26,000 Palestinians, according to the local health
          ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the United States officially maintaining that it is not at war
          in the region, it has conducted strikes against targets of
          Yemen&apos;s Houthi groups, which have been attacking commercial
          vessels in the Red Sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden asserted, &quot;We will carry on their commitment to
          fight terrorism. And have no doubt – we will hold all those
          responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our
          choosing,&quot; as stated in his White House-released statement.

          Environmental officials in Ohio returned to the site of a devastating

          significant diesel fuel spill resulting from the incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crash, which occurred on Saturday morning and tragically claimed
          the life of the driver, involved a tanker carrying approximately 7,500
          gallons (28,390 liters) of diesel, as reported by the Ohio
          Environmental Protection Agency. Following the accident, a nearby
          creek briefly ignited, prompting swift action from the agency to
          contain the fuel spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          To address the environmental impact, response crews are set to
          excavate affected soil, according to the state EPA. Officials will
          maintain a presence at the scene to ensure comprehensive measures are
          taken to safeguard the well-being of residents and protect waterways,

          County Sheriff’s Office and Macedonia Police Department responding to
          the scene at the ramp to Interstate 271 north in Northfield Center
          Township. The tanker, traveling northbound on State Route 8, attempted
          to access Interstate 271 north when the driver lost control, leading
          the vehicle to go over the bridge&apos;s side, according to the
          sheriff’s office.

          scene discovered that the tanker driver had succumbed to injuries
          sustained in the crash.
        </p>

          The Sorabi district of Kabul province, situated on the primary highway
