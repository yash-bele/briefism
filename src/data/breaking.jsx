        In a significant show of support for Moscow, North Korea has given
        Russia ballistic missiles and missile launchers that were utilized in
        recent attacks on Ukraine, the White House announced on Thursday.
        <br />
        <br />
        Russia is reportedly in need of missiles from its ally Iran because,
        almost two years after President Vladimir Putin&apos;s invasion of
        Ukraine, it is out of supplies. According to National Security Council
        spokesman John Kirby, Russia launched two strikes on Ukraine in the last
        week using missiles supplied by Pyongyang that have a range of about 900
        kilometers.
        <br />
        <br />
        During a briefing at the White House, Kirby informed reporters,
        &quot;Our information indicates that the Democratic People&apos;s
        Republic of Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missile
        launchers and several ballistic missiles.&quot; &quot;This is a major
        and worrisome increase in the DPRK&apos;s backing of Russia.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        The event demonstrated how urgently the US Congress must approve a
        package of crucial military aid for Ukraine, or else the supply of
        assistance will quickly run out, Kirby continued. He declared that
        Ukraine&apos;s air defenses were &quot;absolutely&quot; a priority,
        given that the country has recently been the target of numerous aerial
        attacks by Russia. Congress must convene immediately and act to give the
        Ukrainian people the tools they need to defend themselves.

            As it constitutes a violation of UN sanctions against North Korea,
            the US and its allies will now bring up the issue at the UN Security
            Council, according to Kirby. The use of North Korean missiles by
            Russia has drawn strong condemnation from Britain.
          </span>
          <span>
            &quot;Russia is pursuing its misguided and cynical military
            objectives in Ukraine by looking to North Korea for its armaments.
            This is an indication of its desperation and a symptom of its
            isolation on the international scene&quot;, according to a Foreign
            Office statement. It further stated that North Korea would pay a
            &quot;high price&quot; for breaking UN sanctions.
          </span>
          <span>
            According to Kirby, negotiations are ongoing to acquire close-range
            ballistic missiles, but no deal has been reached. Russia also plans
            to buy missiles from its ally Iran.
          </span>
          <span>
            Although it was the first time the US had acknowledged the use of
            such weapons, the US said in October that North Korea had shipped
            more than 1,000 containers filled with armaments and military
            hardware to Russia. After meeting with Putin in September in the far
            east of Russia, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un alarmed Kyiv&apos;s
            allies by raising the prospect of an arms deal.
          </span>
          <span>
            Following an unprecedented attack on the Russian city of Belgorod
            over the weekend, Putin, who began his invasion of Ukraine in
            February 2022, pledged to step up his sanctions against the country.
            According to Kyiv, the most recent attacks highlight the necessity
            for Western allies to expedite the delivery of long-range missiles,
            combat drones, and air defense systems.
          </span>
          <span>
            In his New Year&apos;s speech last week, Ukrainian President
            Volodymyr Zelensky threatened to exact &quot;wrath&quot; on Russian
            forces in 2024, a warning that Kyiv has increased domestic
            production.

        In a historic accomplishment, 13-year-old Willis Gibson, popularly known
        as &quot;blue scuti,&quot; has become the first person to reach the
        elusive &quot;kill screen&quot; in the Tetris game for Nintendo. Prior
        to this, it was believed that artificial intelligence could only
        accomplish this feat. Willis captured the intense moment when he pushed
        the iconic computer game to its limits in an engrossing over 40-minute
        video that was posted to YouTube this week, documenting his incredible
        feat.
        <br />
        <br />
        Willis&apos; video&apos;s poignant finale contrasts sharply with the
        preceding thirty-five minutes of intense gameplay. Despite his fast
        finger movements on the controller, the competitive gamer from Oklahoma
        handled the falling blocks with poise. The Tetris community, comprising
        players from both online and live tournaments, praised this historic
        achievement, describing it as something that many had previously thought
        was impossible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Vince Clemente, President of the Classic Tetris World Championship, said
        of Willis&apos; accomplishment, &quot;It&apos;s never been done by a
        human before.&quot; It is essentially something that, until a few years
        ago, everyone believed to be impossible.&quot; A Soviet software
        engineer created the game Tetris, which requires players to rotate and
        manipulate falling blocks to form solid lines inside of boxes. Players
        have tested the game&apos;s boundaries over time, finding ways to
        advance past what was initially thought to be the game&apos;s endpoint.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-xl">Cracking the code</span>
        <br />
        Because the blocks fell so quickly in Level 29, many people thought it
        was the last challenge in the game. But new developments in gameplay
        have made it possible for players to go beyond this point. When Willis
        got to Level 157 on December 21, he dropped a piece that set off a
        glitch that made the game freeze and a single line of blocks disappear.
        For the first time, a player who wasn&apos;t a computer made it to the
        elusive &quot;kill screen.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-xl">
          What is the &quot;kill screen&quot; in Tetris?
        </span>
        <br />
        In Tetris, the &quot;kill screen&quot; refers to a stage where an error
        occurs that stops the game from moving forward. On the Nintendo version,
        Willis Gibson became the first person to reach this milestone.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span className="text-xl">
          Why does Willis&apos; accomplishment matter?
        </span>
        <br />
        The accomplishment of Willis Gibson is noteworthy because he achieved a
        level in Tetris that was previously believed to be exclusive to
        artificial intelligence, setting new records.

        The U.S. Navy said that although a Houthi drone boat loaded with
        explosives exploded in the Red Sea on Thursday, it did not result in any
        damage or casualties. The Yemen-based group has been attacking despite
        calls from other countries to cease.
        <br />
        <br />
        The most recent attack occurred one day after a group of 12 nations,
        including the United States, Britain, and Japan, issued a statement
        warning the Houthis that there would be &quot;consequences&quot; if they
        continued their attacks. A U.S. official suggested on Wednesday that
        this was the last warning.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since November 19, the Houthis, who control a large portion of Yemen and
        are aligned with Iran, have been firing waves of rockets and drones at
        commercial ships in an apparent attempt to cause damage in response to
        Israel&apos;s military actions in Gaza.
        <br />
        <br />
        International shipping has been severely disrupted by the Houthi
        campaign; as a result, some companies have decided to forgo transits
        through the Red Sea in favor of the more expensive and time-consuming
        route around Africa.
        <br />
        <br />
        The head of U.S. naval forces in the Middle East, Vice Admiral Brad
        Cooper, informed reporters on Thursday that the Houthi explosive boat
        penetrated about 50 miles (80 km) into the Red Sea before exploding in
        crowded shipping lanes.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;We all watched as it exploded, coming within a couple of miles of
        ships operating in the area, merchant ships and U.S. Navy ships,&quot;
        Cooper said reporters, adding that it was unclear what the attack&apos;s
        precise target was.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cooper stated that &quot;there are no signs that their irresponsible
        behavior is abating.&quot; The Houthis have now launched 25 attacks
        against merchant vessels that are navigating the southern Red Sea and
        the Gulf of Aden.
        <br />
        <br />
        President Joe Biden is under more pressure to respond militarily as a
        result of the ongoing Houthi attacks, but his administration has been
        hesitant to do so for fear of worsening the already high levels of
        tension in the region.
