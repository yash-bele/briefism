          The music of notable artists such as Taylor Swift, Drake, and Olivia
          Rodrigo is set to vanish from TikTok by the end of Wednesday, unless a
          deal is struck with Universal Music Group (UMG). With an estimated 1.5
          billion monthly users, TikTok plays a crucial role in the contemporary
          music ecosystem, allowing users to incorporate songs from major record
          label catalogs into their videos. However, UMG announced early
          Wednesday that it would remove its tracks due to inadequate
          compensation for artists and songwriters.

          In a statement, UMG expressed dissatisfaction with TikTok&apos;s
          proposed payment rate, citing it as a fraction of what other major
          social platforms pay for similar content. Responding promptly, TikTok,
          owned by the Chinese company Bytedance, criticized UMG for
          prioritizing &quot;greed above the interests of artists and
          songwriters.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          UMG, a Dutch-American-owned entity, emphasized that TikTok contributes
          only 1% to its advertising revenue, despite its artists dominating the
          platform&apos;s popularity charts. Notably, UMG artists accounted for
          eight out of ten of the most popular acts on TikTok in 2023, while
          approximately 60% of TikTok videos feature music. UMG, part of the
          &quot;Big Three&quot; global music companies, boasts licensed artists
          such as The Beatles, Elton John, Bob Dylan, Ariana Grande, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an open letter titled &quot;Why We Must Call Time Out on
          TikTok,&quot; UMG conveyed its concern that TikTok aims to establish a
          music-centric business without adequately compensating for the music
          it utilizes. The letter also highlighted UMG&apos;s worries about the
          impact of artificial intelligence tools in TikTok videos on
          intellectual property and raised issues regarding copyright
          infringement, hate speech, bigotry, bullying, and harassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          During negotiations, UMG claimed that TikTok attempted to coerce
          acceptance of a deal worth less than the previous arrangement,
          considerably below fair market value, and not reflective of
          TikTok&apos;s exponential growth. UMG further alleged that TikTok
          engaged in selective removal of music from certain developing artists
          while retaining content from global stars with substantial audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          TikTok has not specifically addressed UMG&apos;s allegations but
          accused the music company of creating a &quot;false narrative and
          rhetoric.&quot; TikTok emphasized its ability to secure deals with
          other major music labels and highlighted its partnership with Warner
          Music Group last year. Defending its position, TikTok asserted that
          UMG chose to walk away from a platform with well over a billion users,
          serving as a free promotional and discovery tool for their talent.

          Chinese government hackers are currently directing their efforts
          towards critical infrastructure in the United States, including water
          treatment plants, the electrical grid, and transportation systems,
          warns FBI Director Chris Wray. In a testimony before House lawmakers,
          Wray emphasizes the urgent need for public attention to the cyber
          threat posed by China, stating that it affects every American. He
          underscores that China&apos;s hackers are strategically positioning
          themselves within American infrastructure, with the potential to cause
          real-world harm to citizens and communities when they decide to
          strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          This warning aligns with assessments from cybersecurity firms like
          Microsoft, which reported in May that state-backed Chinese hackers
          were actively targeting US critical infrastructure. These hackers,
          according to Microsoft, might be laying the groundwork for disrupting
          crucial communications between the US and Asia during future crises.
          Additionally, Mandiant disclosed in the following month that suspected
          state-backed Chinese hackers exploited a security vulnerability in a
          widely used email security appliance to breach the networks of
          numerous public and private sector organizations globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wray&apos;s concerns extend beyond cybersecurity threats to encompass
          the Chinese government&apos;s persistent attempts to steal scientific
          and industrial research from American businesses. Despite China
          dismissing these accusations as baseless, numerous criminal
          indictments have provided detailed evidence of their hacking
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Highlighting the severity of the situation, Wray emphasizes that China
          is actively targeting economic security, engaging in large-scale theft
          of innovation, and compromising personal and corporate data on a daily
          basis. The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party,
          chaired by Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, was
          established to counter China and address its growing influence. The
          committee has faced criticism from the Chinese government, which has
          accused its members of harboring ideological bias and adopting a Cold
          War mentality.

          Billionaire Sultan Ibrahim officially assumed the role of
          Malaysia&apos;s new king on Wednesday during a ceremony held at the
          national palace in Kuala Lumpur. In the presence of fellow royal
          families, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and Cabinet members, he signed
          the instrument of the proclamation of office. The formal coronation
          ceremony for the 65-year-old Sultan from the historic state of Johor,
          with a lineage dating back to the 16th century, is scheduled for a
          later date.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Malaysia&apos;s distinctive rotational monarchy system, the heads
          of the country&apos;s nine royal families take turns serving as the
          King, known as the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; (He Who is Made
          Lord), with each term lasting five years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sultan Ibrahim, recognized for his outspokenness, has frequently
          expressed opinions on Malaysia&apos;s political matters and asserted a
          positive relationship with the current prime minister. In an interview
          with the Singapore Straits Times, he emphasized a commitment to
          actively address corruption and promote unity during his tenure,
          declaring his intention not to be a mere &quot;puppet king.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          As one of the nation&apos;s wealthiest individuals, Sultan Ibrahim
          possesses a vast collection of luxury vehicles and motorcycles, along
          with diverse business interests spanning real estate to a stake in the
          $100-billion China-backed Forest City project off Johor&apos;s coast.
          His family&apos;s private jet fleet, including three Gulfstreams and a
          gold-and-blue Boeing 737, highlights the extent of his wealth, as
          reported by Bloomberg.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sultan has advocated for the creation of a special economic zone
          between Johor and neighboring Singapore to strengthen ties.
          Additionally, he expressed plans to revive a stalled high-speed rail
          project between Malaysia and Singapore. Notably, Johor is the sole
          sultanate permitted to maintain its private army, a historical
          agreement dating back to its entry into the Federation of Malaya
          before Malaysia gained independence in 1957.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintaining close ties with Singapore&apos;s leadership and having
          business collaborations with major Chinese property developers, Sultan
          Ibrahim is positioned to wield more influence over both domestic and
          foreign policy than any previous Malaysian monarch, according to a
          Bloomberg report.

          The Bandra Kurla Complex police station has registered a First
          Information Report (FIR) against 41 owners of high-end cars, SUVs, and
          sports cars for conducting an unauthorized joyride and car rally on
          Republic Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car owners, primarily sons of prominent figures in the city&apos;s
          diamond, bullion, real estate, and share markets, residing in Napean
          Sea Road, Bandra, Khar, and Andheri, were charged by the police. The
          rally, featuring impounded vehicles such as Ferraris, Porsches,
          Lamborghinis, Mercedes cars, Audis, Jaguars, and BMWs, took place
          without obtaining the required permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to police sources, the rally, which had been an annual event
          for the past decade, was organized by an event and social media
          company. Scheduled to commence at 6 am from Jio World Drive Mall, BKC,
          with an anticipated participation of 100 cars, only half of them
          showed up. The plan was to traverse the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link
          (MTHL) and return to BKC.
        </p>
        <p>
          An alert about the rule violations was raised on social media platform
          X (formerly Twitter), prompting the police&apos;s social media team to
          inform senior officers. The BKC police station then intervened,
          questioning the car owners about permission, which they confirmed not
          having. Consequently, a case was registered against them under
          relevant sections for organizing a rally without permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 41 individuals, including college students, face charges under
          sections 188 (deliberate disobedience of a legally promulgated order
          by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and 135, 37(1), and
          37(3) of the Maharashtra Police Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, one of the car owners asserted that they had not
          commenced the rally and would have canceled the plan if the police had
          instructed them to do so due to the absence of permission. However, an
          FIR was lodged without heeding their explanation. The police are
          actively investigating the matter and obtaining details from the
          Regional Transport Office (RTO).

          A recently released FBI report reveals that approximately one in ten

          collected from 2018 to 2022, highlights schools as the third most
          common setting for hate crimes, following residences and roadways or
          alleys. Despite widespread closures during the 2020-2021 academic year
          due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools remained prominent locations for
          such incidents.

          Black students emerged as the primary targets of hate crimes in
          educational settings, followed by victims from Jewish and LGBTQ
          communities. The surge in hate crimes across the country is evident in
          FBI records, with reported bias crimes increasing from about 8,500 in
          2018 to over 13,300 in 2022, reaching a record high.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of hate incidents reported within schools experienced an
          even more substantial spike, nearly doubling over the five-year
          period, rising from 700 in 2018 to 1,336 in 2022. Notably, this
          accounted for 10% of all reported hate crimes in the country, with
          almost two-thirds occurring in kindergarten-through-12th grade
          institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts caution that hate crimes are likely undercounted due to
          subjective evaluations by law enforcement agencies regarding
          discriminatory intent. Many victims opt not to report incidents to the
          police out of fear of reprisal. The rise in hate incidents is a
          concerning trend, reflecting broader societal challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the ongoing conflict in Gaza, initiated by Hamas attacks on
          Israel in October, has contributed to a notable increase in both
          antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents across the United States, as
          reported by advocacy groups. This context underscores the
          interconnected nature of global events and their impact on hate crime
          trends within the country.

          34 others sustaining injuries, as reported by President Joe Biden and
          U.S. officials on Sunday.

          President Biden attributed the attack to Iran-backed groups, stating,
          &quot;While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know
          it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in
          Syria and Iraq.&quot;

          A U.S. official informed Reuters that at least 34 personnel were

          region since the conflict in Gaza. President Biden revealed that the
          attack occurred on Saturday night.

          The incident significantly escalates the already tense situation in
          the Middle East, where conflict erupted in Gaza following an attack by
          the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas on Israel on Oct. 7, resulting in
          1,200 casualties. Israel&apos;s subsequent assault on Gaza has led to
          the death of over 26,000 Palestinians, according to the local health
          ministry.

          Despite the United States officially maintaining that it is not at war
          in the region, it has conducted strikes against targets of
          Yemen&apos;s Houthi groups, which have been attacking commercial
          vessels in the Red Sea.

          President Biden asserted, &quot;We will carry on their commitment to
          fight terrorism. And have no doubt – we will hold all those
          responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our
          choosing,&quot; as stated in his White House-released statement.
