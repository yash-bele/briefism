          More than 100,000 devotees are expected to congregate in Ayodhya on
          January 22 for the Ram Mandir&apos;s &quot;pran pratishtha&quot;
          ceremony, according to the reports. It is planned for Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi to attend the function.

          The general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, Champat
          Rai, says that the Ram temple will have particular dimensions and be
          built in the traditional Nagara style. 161 feet in height, 250 feet in
          width, and 380 feet long from east to west. The temple will have
          twenty feet on each floor, three hundred and ninety-two pillars, and
          forty-four gates.

          Chief of the Shiv Sena, Uddhav Thackeray, announced that he would
          perform a Maha Aarti at the Godavari riverbank in Nashik on January
          22, which is the day the Ram temple in Ayodhya opens. He also plans to
          go to the Kalaram temple in Panchavati, which is thought to be the
          location of Lord Ram&apos;s stay during his banishment. Although
          Uddhav was not invited to the inauguration of the Ram temple, Shiv
          Sena and BJP leaders got into a verbal altercation over this.

          Social media was rocked by Maldivian politicians&apos; remarks about
          Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&apos;s visit to Lakshadweep, which
          revealed more about the two nations&apos; relationship than just
          tourism.

          Mohamed Muizzu, the recently elected president of the Maldives, has
          requested that India remove its troops from the island nation. The
          troops are in charge of three exquisite aircraft that are being used
          for patrol.
        </p>
        <p>
          What really infuriated Indians, though, were remarks made by
          politicians in the Maldives that were deemed racist. As a result, many
          Indians called for a boycott of travel to the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous well-known people have expressed their support for
          Modi&apos;s expedition and encouraged tourists to visit Indian
          islands.

            Maldives tourism is dominated by India
          </span>
          <p>
            The tourism industry, which generates the majority of the
            country&apos;s foreign exchange earnings and government revenue, is
            a major contributor to the Maldivian economy. Due to its gorgeous
            beaches, opulent lodging options, and mouthwatering seafood, the
            island nation has become a popular travel destination in South Asia.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Maldivian Tourism Ministry reports that 161,751 arrivals from
          India were registered in November 2023 alone, making up nearly 20% of
          all arrivals. In the meantime, Indians held the second position in
          market share from January to November 2023, accounting for 10.9
          percent of all arrivals, or 181, 371 arrivals, in the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          India ranked as the fifth-largest country from which tourists arrived
          in the Maldives in 2018. Approximately 6.1% (more than 90,474) of the
          14,84,274 tourists came from India. Nevertheless, India ranked second
          in 2019 with 1,66,030 arrivals, nearly twice as many as the previous
          year. With almost 63,000 Indian tourists visiting the Maldives in the
          pandemic-hit year 2020, India accounted for the Maldives&apos; largest
          source market. With over 2.91 lakh and 2.41 lakh tourist arrivals from
          India, respectively, and a 23 percent and 14.4 percent market share,
          India remained the leading market in 2021 and 2022.

            Education, finance, and defense: India helps the Maldives
          </span>
          <p>
            India and the Maldives have collaborated closely in defense and
            security since 1988. Regarding meeting the Maldives&apos;
            requirements for defense hardware and training, India has been
            incredibly accommodating and adaptable. As of late, it has signed a
            comprehensive Action Plan for Defence in April 2016 and has
            continued to provide defense hardware, upgrade defense
            infrastructure, and train Maldivian forces.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Regarding financial support, the Maldives received an additional $100
          million in funding from the Modi administration in November 2022. The
          help came in the shape of budgetary support to help the archipelago
          nation get through its challenging economic times. It should be
          mentioned that the aid is being provided unconditionally, and the
          Maldives has been allowed to use it however it sees fit to aid in its
          economic recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          India further solidified its reputation as the “first responder” when
          it quickly sent 30,000 doses of the measles vaccine to the Maldives in
          January 2020 to stop an outbreak. India also provided the Maldives
          with prompt, all-encompassing assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, a number of young Maldivians attend Indian universities to
          pursue higher education. For many years, Maldivian schools located
          throughout the islands have employed Indian educators. Maldivian youth
          have historically been awarded a significant number of ICCR
          scholarships by India, specifically 39 for 2021-2022 and 34+ for
          2022-2023 & 2023-2024.

            Following PM Modi&apos;s visit, a number of prospective tourists
            canceled their plans due to remarks made by Zahid Rameez, a council
            member of the Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM), that were
            disparaging and included a reference to a &quot;permanent smell in
            the rooms.&quot;
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In a statement, the Maldives government promised to take the
          appropriate action against the individuals, stating that these
          opinions are personal and do not reflect the government&apos;s views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many Indian travelers expressed their displeasure on social media and
          threatened to cancel their vacation plans to the Maldives in protest.

            There is very little plot protection for characters in this violent
            series; people can die, be consumed, beaten, tortured, shot,
            crushed, and more. But since it&apos;s an animated program, the
            violence isn&apos;t depicted any more graphically than it would be
            in a show like Game of Thrones. Characters are occasionally seen
            smoking and drinking wine, but these scenes don&apos;t have a
            recurring theme.
