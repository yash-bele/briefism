          In a significant victory, Donald Trump has emerged as the clear winner
          in the New Hampshire Republican primary, securing over 54% of the
          vote. His closest rival, Nikki Haley, trailed behind with just over
          43% of the vote. This win positions Trump one step closer to clinching
          the Republican nomination for the upcoming US presidential election.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary allowed both registered Republicans and independents to
          participate in the voting process. Trump&apos;s decisive victory
          effectively halted Haley&apos;s pursuit of the nomination. Despite her
          acknowledgment of Trump&apos;s win, Haley asserted that New Hampshire
          was just the beginning of the primaries and shifted her focus to South
          Carolina, her home state, where the primaries are scheduled for
          February 27.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Trump expressed his irritation at Haley&apos;s decision to
          continue in the race, labeling her as an &quot;imposter&quot; who
          behaved as if she had won. Exit polls revealed that Trump secured more
          votes across various demographics, including men, women, different age
          groups, and geographical regions, showcasing his enduring influence
          over the core Republican Party base.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following Trump&apos;s triumph in Iowa last week, where he garnered
          more votes than his closest competitors combined, Ron DeSantis, Haley,
          and Vivek Ramaswamy, both DeSantis and Ramaswamy withdrew from the
          race and endorsed Trump. In contrast, Haley persisted, relying on
          independent voters and an aggressive campaign against Trump. Despite
          her victories in certain segments, such as college graduates and
          independent voters, Trump overwhelmingly dominated every other
          demographic.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Associated Press declared Trump the winner on Tuesday night,
          Haley addressed her supporters, congratulating Trump but asserting
          that the race was far from over. She emphasized that New Hampshire was
          just the first of many primaries, with dozens of states yet to hold
          their elections. Haley highlighted her resilience, describing herself
          as a fighter and expressing determination to continue alongside Trump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haley acknowledged agreement with many of Trump&apos;s policies,
          having voted for him and served in his administration. However, she
          emphasized the need to move beyond what she characterized as
          &quot;negativity and chaos&quot; associated with Trump&apos;s
          candidacy. Haley also questioned Trump&apos;s electability, pointing
          to losses in the previous four elections under his leadership. She
          suggested that it was an open secret that Democrats preferred Trump as
          the Republican candidate, viewing him as Biden&apos;s best chance of
          regaining the presidency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning her attention to South Carolina, Haley&apos;s home state,
          where she served as governor, she positioned herself as a viable
          candidate. However, recent polls indicate a significant lead for Trump
          in South Carolina, enjoying support from the state&apos;s senators and
          governor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Trump&apos;s victory speech, he criticized Haley for behaving as if
          she had won and urged her to acknowledge her loss. He reiterated his
          focus on turning around the economy, securing the border, cutting
          taxes, removing regulations, and defeating Biden in the upcoming
          elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Republican battle shifting to Nevada, US Virgin Islands, and
          then South Carolina, Haley&apos;s chances of securing the nomination
          appear challenging. While a strong performance in her home state could
          prolong her candidacy, analysts see New Hampshire as her best
          opportunity, given the state&apos;s electorate, primary rules, and her
          investments, making her nomination increasingly unlikely.

          The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has declared that its services
          will commence at 4 am on January 26, facilitating commuters to utilize
          metro trains for reaching Kartavya Path to attend the Republic Day
          parade. Through X (formerly Twitter), DMRC shared information about
          service timings and specified stations for alighting based on the
          entry gates used by passengers to access the parade.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the announcement, DMRC stated, “Delhi Metro will commence its
          services at 4:00 AM on all its Lines to facilitate the public to reach
          Kartavya Path to witness the Republic Day ceremony on 26th January
          2024 (Friday). Train services will be available at a headway of 30
          minutes till 06:00 AM and thereafter, a regular timetable will be
          followed for the rest of the day.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Passengers holding e-invitation cards or e-tickets for the Republic
          Day ceremony will be provided with coupons upon presenting a valid
          government-issued photo identity card at stations. These coupons will
          permit exits exclusively from the Central Secretariat and Udyog Bhawan
          metro stations to reach Kartavya Path. A similar coupon will also be
          applicable for the return journey, exclusively from these two
          stations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For passengers alighting at stations based on their assigned enclosure
          numbers, the Delhi Metro has issued specific guidelines. Passengers
          with enclosure numbers 1 to 9, VI & V2 are instructed to alight at
          Udyog Bhawan Metro Station. Similarly, individuals with enclosure
          numbers 10 to 24 and VN are recommended to exit at the Central
          Secretariat Metro Station. DMRC assured that regular announcements
          inside the trains will inform passengers about this to facilitate
          smooth access to their enclosures.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for this year&apos;s parade, which anticipates 77,000
          invitees at Kartavya Path, extensive security measures have been
          implemented, according to the police, as reported by PTI. Special
          Commissioner of Police (Security) Dependra Pathak emphasized the
          implementation of professional, robust, and impeccable security
          measures throughout Delhi for Republic Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;We have divided the New Delhi district, where the parade will
          take place, into 28 zones to ensure security. Senior officers head
          these zones,&quot; Tiwari was quoted as saying by PTI.
        </p>
        <p>
          To enhance security measures, booths for missing persons, help desks,
          first-aid kiosks, and separate facilitation booths for depositing
          vehicle keys before the parade have been established. Tiwari urged
          attendees to arrive promptly at the venue and cooperate with security
          personnel during the comprehensive security checks that will be
          conducted.

        <p>
          In the last quarter of 2023, Netflix experienced a significant surge
          in its subscriber base, adding 13.1 million new subscriptions. This
          growth exceeded earlier estimates of 8.97 million subscribers and
          stands as the streaming giant&apos;s most substantial expansion since
          the beginning of the pandemic. The boost in sign-ups at the close of
          the year is attributed to the company&apos;s initiative to tackle
          password-sharing by encouraging individual account creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The streaming platform&apos;s stock witnessed a 10% surge, instilling
          confidence among investors, fueled by robust subscriber growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Netflix&apos;s success in the streaming landscape has been
          highlighted, with Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak
          stating, &quot;Netflix has already won the streaming wars, and this
          type of strong result/guidance, especially relative to its streaming
          peers, is what winning looks like,&quot; according to Reuters.
        </p>
        <p>
          As reported by Reuters, some analysts argue that Netflix&apos;s
          valuation is justifiable, especially with other streaming companies
          increasingly prioritizing profitability. This trend may lead these
          companies to license more content to Netflix, potentially boosting
          subscriber numbers and average revenue per user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Netflix&apos;s stock maintains a premium position compared to its
          competitors, trading at nearly 30 times its 12-month forward earnings,
          in contrast to Walt Disney Co&apos;s 20.41, according to LSEG data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an ironic twist, considering its historical reluctance to sell ads,
          Netflix&apos;s gains have come at a time when it previously resisted
          incorporating ads due to concerns about compromising viewer experience
          and potential privacy risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Facing a dip in subscribers and profits in the first half of 2022,
          Netflix sought innovative strategies to attract new viewers and
          generate additional revenue. &quot;We largely put price increases on
          hold as we rolled out paid sharing. Now that we&apos;re through that,
          we&apos;re able to resume our standard approach,&quot; said co-chief
          executive Greg Peters, as reported by BBC.
        </p>
        <p>
          The introduction of a more affordable plan that includes
          advertisements saw significant adoption among new Netflix members. In
          the 12 countries where ads were introduced, including major markets
          like the UK and the US, this particular plan constituted 40% of new
          subscriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This growth signifies a significant shift for a company that long
          opposed ad sales, citing potential negative impacts on viewer
          experience and complications for its business due to privacy risks and
          other concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Netflix has allocated up to $17 billion for content this year,
          responding to disruptions caused by dual Hollywood strikes involving
          actors and writers in the previous year. Additionally, the company is
          placing increased emphasis on live programming, as demonstrated by a
          recent announcement of a rights deal exceeding $5 billion. This deal
          aims to secure exclusive rights to World Wrestling
          Entertainment&apos;s “Raw” and other content for their platform
          starting January 2025.

        <p>
          Recent reports indicate that Hamas, the Palestinian militant group
          controlling Gaza, has seen a significant increase in its funding from
          online donations over the past few months. According to Israeli
          financial intelligence officials speaking to Bloomberg, Hamas is
          estimated to be receiving between $8 to $12 million per month from
          online fundraising campaigns run by organizations posing as charities
          to assist civilians in Gaza. This marks a major uptick from the
          group&apos;s pre-conflict levels of online fundraising. The US
          government is said to concur with the Israeli assessment regarding the
          scale of Hamas&apos; current online funding streams.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking and disrupting Hamas&apos; funding has long posed challenges
          given the group&apos;s extensive experience evading sanctions and
          scrutiny. Matthew Levitt, an expert at the Washington Institute for
          Near East Policy, noted that while there has been a pronounced surge
          in legitimate and illegitimate charitable donations to Palestinians
          since the outbreak of hostilities, this also provides cover for Hamas
          fundraising. He pointed out that some charities previously designated
          by the US as fronts have re-emerged using new names, alongside many
          new entities whose intent is unclear.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to recent escalations, Hamas financing often flowed through
          charities, with funds eventually reaching the group through mechanisms
          like aid convoys, according to Israeli officials. Hamas also utilizes
          trade-based schemes, pressuring Gazan business owners to
          surreptitiously transmit payments. However, definitively ascertaining
          whether a purported charity genuinely intends to aid civilians or
          covertly back Hamas poses an enduring obstacle, the officials say.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, Hamas leverages organizations in third countries without
          overt ties to the militant faction to raise capital, per Israeli and
          US authorities. The group&apos;s officials have openly appealed for
          monetary &quot;gifts&quot; to assist their fight against Israel,
          framing it as a form of virtuous struggle.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes as Israel has pledged to militarily dismantle Hamas after
          it fired barrages of rockets into southern Israel from Gaza, resulting
          in around 1,200 Israeli fatalities. Over 25,000 Palestinians have been
          killed since the outbreak of hostilities as Israel struck back
          forcefully at Gaza. With tensions still simmering, the influx of
          funding provides Hamas with resources to potentially sustain and
          expand military capabilities directed against Israel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the recent conflict has catalyzed a surge in online donations
          to alleged Gaza aid efforts, with Israeli and US officials contending
          that Hamas is siphoning off a significant fraction of these funds for
          its own purposes. However, the opacity around some fundraising
          initiatives and Hamas&apos; experience obscuring financial flows
          continue to pose challenges to restricting its access to capital. The
          scale of the purported uptick in Hamas financing illustrates the
          complexity of impeding resources from reaching armed factions during
          times of active conflict and humanitarian crisis.

          GOP Presidential hopeful Nikki Haley encountered an unexpected moment
          during a rally in New Hampshire on Monday when a supporter of Donald
          Trump disrupted her speech with an impromptu marriage proposal. The
          incident took place at the Artisan Hotel in Salem, where the
          52-year-old presidential contender was addressing her supporters about
          the significance of the upcoming election on the eve of the New
          Hampshire primary.
        </p>
        <p>
          While discussing key election issues, a man from the crowd interrupted
          Haley with the question, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; The
          unanticipated proposal elicited laughter from the audience, including
          Haley herself. Responding in a composed manner, the former South
          Carolina governor, who is already married to Maj. Michael Haley,
          countered by asking the man if he would vote for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a brief pause, the man declared his allegiance to Trump, drawing
          disapproval from fellow rally attendees. Unfazed by the response,
          Haley straightforwardly told the man to &quot;get out,&quot;
          expressing her displeasure at the interruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, in the New Hampshire presidential primary held the
          following day, Haley secured the second position after former US
          President Donald Trump. Trump emerged victorious in the Republican
          presidential primary, consolidating his position as the leading
          candidate for the Republican Party. Despite not actively campaigning,
          current US President Joe Biden secured the win for the Democrats in
          New Hampshire.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Trump&apos;s consecutive wins, he began to solidify his standing
          as the frontrunner for the Republican Presidential candidacy, shaping
          the political landscape leading up to the election.

          In the recent New Hampshire primaries, former US President Donald
          Trump secured a victory in the Republican presidential primary,
          marking his second consecutive win after Iowa. Despite not actively
          campaigning, current US President Joe Biden emerged victorious for the
          Democrats, positioning both leaders for a potential rematch in the
          November 2024 presidential election.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Trump&apos;s win in Iowa and New Hampshire, a re-match with his
          Democratic counterpart, Biden, becomes increasingly likely. Former
          South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, a rival to Trump, aimed to
          disrupt the political landscape in the crucial state but ultimately
          finished second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edison Research reported that Trump secured 52.3% of the vote compared
          to Haley&apos;s 46.6% after tallying 14% of the votes, according to
          Reuters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden&apos;s win in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, achieved as
          a write-in candidate without campaigning or appearing on the ballot,
          defied party rules, as the primary in the key state preceded South
          Carolina&apos;s, according to the Associated Press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump&apos;s victories in Iowa and New Hampshire marked the first time
          a Republican accomplished a sweep in these states since 1976, setting
          the stage for the top candidates to contend for the White House.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Hampshire primary witnessed the first one-on-one faceoff
          between Trump and Haley after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, initially
          considered Trump&apos;s challenger, withdrew and endorsed the former
          president.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the setback in New Hampshire, Haley is determined to mount a
          robust challenge in the upcoming primary in her home state, South
          Carolina, scheduled for February 24. Previously finishing third in
          Iowa, Haley is anticipated to present a formidable opposition,
          possibly offering a chance to defeat Trump and secure a state victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, despite Trump&apos;s success in New Hampshire, exit polls
          indicate potential challenges in his election campaign. Facing
          multiple criminal charges, including attempts to overturn the 2020
          election and payments to an adult star for silence, Trump may
          encounter obstacles. Edison&apos;s exit poll revealed that nearly half
          of Republican primary voters questioned Trump&apos;s fitness to serve
          if convicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, while Edison predicted Biden&apos;s triumph in the New
          Hampshire Democratic primary, over two-thirds of Republican primary
          voters expressed dissatisfaction with the American economy, citing it
          as either poor or not good, according to Reuters.

          On Tuesday, a Pakistani court reinstated the bail of former Prime
          Minister Imran Khan in seven cases related to the May 9 violence on
          military installations. The Lahore High Court&apos;s decision may not
          offer respite to the 71-year-old leader of the Pakistan
          Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) ahead of the upcoming general polls on February
          8.
        </p>
        <p>
          This legal development follows the Supreme Court of Pakistan&apos;s
          January 13 decision to strip the PTI of its signature cricket
          &apos;bat&apos; election symbol. Consequently, individuals contesting
          elections under the PTI banner must now run as independent candidates.
          The election commission of Pakistan has already rejected nomination
          papers for Khan and several of his party associates.
        </p>
        <p>
          A two-judge bench comprising Justice Aalia Neelum and Justice Farooq
          Haider at the Lahore High Court heard Khan&apos;s petition challenging
          the Anti-Terrorism Court&apos;s (ATC) decision to dismiss his
          pre-arrest bail petitions in the May 9 cases. This dismissal occurred
          subsequent to Khan&apos;s arrest and conviction in the Toshakhana
          case, related to the national treasury gifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Tuesday&apos;s hearing, Khan&apos;s counsel, Barrister Salman
          Safdar, argued that the trial court had wrongfully dismissed his
          client&apos;s bail petitions in his absence, citing imprisonment as
          the reason for non-appearance. Safdar contended that Imran Khan, being
          incarcerated at the time, should have been summoned from jail before
          the trial court made decisions on his bail petitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safdar urged the court to overturn the trial court&apos;s order and
          instruct it to evaluate the bail petition based on its merits. Law
          officer Farhad Ali Shah opposed the petition, asserting that the trial
          court had correctly dismissed Imran Khan&apos;s bail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to expectations, the bench delivered a verdict in favor of
          Khan, restoring his pre-arrest bail petitions. Additionally, the
          Lahore High Court directed the trial court to register Khan&apos;s
          attendance via video link from jail and evaluate his bail petitions on
          their merits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Anti-Terrorism Court had previously dismissed Khan&apos;s
          pre-arrest bail in seven cases linked to the May 9 riots, including
          attacks on the Lahore Corps Commander’s House. On that day, PTI
          supporters vandalized numerous military installations, such as the
          Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase, and the
          ISI building in Faisalabad. The incident marked the first time the mob
          attacked the Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imran Khan contends that the May 9 violence targeted his party and
          alleges a conspiracy outlined in the &apos;London agreement,&apos;
          suggesting that the powerful Pakistan Army is favoring Pakistan Muslim
          League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif.

          A team from the Enforcement Directorate has arrived at the residence
          of Shahjahan Sheikh, a Trinamool Congress leader in Sandeshkhali, West
          Bengal, for a new series of raids related to an alleged ration
          distribution scam. The central agency is conducting the raids with
          heightened security, including the presence of one company of the
          CRPF, and has deployed over 24 cars for the operation. Local police
          are also on the scene to provide assistance during the raids.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes after a previous incident on January 5, when several
          members of the Enforcement Directorate were attacked by a mob in
          Sandeshkhali while en route to Shahjahan&apos;s residence for raids.
          More than 200 locals surrounded the officials&apos; vehicles and
          vandalized them. In connection with this attack, four individuals have
          been arrested from Basirhat, a town in North 24 Parganas, based on
          surveillance footage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bengal Police initiated three FIRs related to the incident,
          including one filed by locals alleging that Enforcement Directorate
          officials were causing disturbances. The Calcutta High Court
          subsequently issued a stay on the police investigation against the
          probe agency officials until March 31.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, another Trinamool Congress leader, Shankar Adhya, former
          Bongaon Municipality Chairman and a co-accused in the alleged ration
          distribution scam, was arrested earlier this month. He was taken into
          Enforcement Directorate custody following searches at his residence in
          Simultola, Bongaon, and properties associated with him and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Shankar Adhya&apos;s hearing, the Enforcement Directorate
          claimed widespread corruption amounting to at least Rs 10,000 crore in
          the ration distribution scam. The agency further alleged that
          approximately Rs 2,000 crore of this sum was illegally funneled to
          Dubai through Shankar Adhya&apos;s company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The involvement of Shankar Adhya came to light through a letter from
          the arrested former Bengal Food Minister, Jyotipriya Mallick, who is
          also implicated in the ration corruption case, according to the probe
          agency.

          Australian High Commissioner to India, Philip Green, expressed his
          perspective on the evolving strategic partnership between India and
          Australia, noting the emergence of a &quot;more confident India.&quot;
          Green welcomed this development, emphasizing the substantial
          cooperation expected between the two nations in the coming years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his first interview with India Today, Green highlighted the shift
          from occasional senior officials&apos; meetings with no fixed agenda
          to now having annual leaders&apos; meetings, structured agendas, and
          dedicated working groups addressing issues systematically. Reflecting
          on the past four to five years, he underscored the significant
          development of the Quad, describing it as a dramatic transformation in
          the regional dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green echoed External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar&apos;s recent
          statement that &quot;India today is much more confident than
          before.&quot; Regarding the Khalistan issue, he reiterated
          Australia&apos;s support for the democratic right to peaceful protest
          while emphasizing the commitment to safeguarding the
          &quot;security&quot; and &quot;dignity&quot; of Indian diplomats and
          missions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing diplomatic relations with China, Green advocated for
          dialogue and diplomacy as the preferred approach to maintain
          stability. While emphasizing the importance of preserving the
          &quot;status quo&quot; along the India-China border, he underscored
          the need to avoid unilateral changes. Green stressed the significance
          of engaging in dialogue with China to navigate bilateral issues within
          established rules and norms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responding to queries about the scheduled Quad meeting around Republic
          Day (January 26), the Australian High Commissioner deferred to the
          Indian Prime Minister&apos;s discretion, acknowledging India&apos;s
          chairmanship of the Quad this year. Green affirmed his Prime
          Minister&apos;s strong commitment to the Quad and expressed
          flexibility regarding the meeting&apos;s timing and location, leaving
          the decision entirely to the Indian Prime Minister, who holds the
          chairmanship.

        <p>
          Today marks the centenary of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji, a stalwart
          whose unwavering commitment to social justice left an indelible impact
          on millions of lives. Although I never had the opportunity to meet
          Karpoori Ji, I&apos;ve heard about him from Kailashpati Mishra Ji, who
          closely collaborated with him. Hailing from the Nai Samaj, one of the
          most backward sections of society, Karpoori Ji overcame numerous
          hurdles, achieving significant milestones for societal betterment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karpoori Thakur Ji&apos;s life was characterized by simplicity and a
          relentless pursuit of social justice. His modest lifestyle and humble
          demeanor resonated with the common people until his last breath.
          Anecdotes abound, illustrating his simplicity, like his preference to
          use personal funds for his daughter&apos;s wedding. During his tenure
          as Bihar&apos;s Chief Minister, a decision to build a colony for
          political leaders was made, yet he declined any allocation of land or
          money for himself. When he passed away in 1988, leaders visiting his
          village were moved to tears witnessing the simplicity of his home.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1977, shortly after assuming office as Bihar&apos;s CM, Karpoori Ji
          attended a Janata leaders&apos; gathering in Patna to commemorate
          Loknayak JP’s birthday. Despite his torn kurta, he declined assistance
          from Chandrashekhar Ji, opting to donate the contributed money to the
          CM Relief Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social justice was Karpoori Thakur Ji&apos;s paramount concern. His
          political journey reflected monumental efforts to create a society
          where resources were equitably distributed, offering opportunities to
          all, irrespective of social standing. He took an anti-Congress stance
          early on, convinced that the party had deviated from its founding
          principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initiating his electoral career in the early 1950s, Karpoori Ji became
          a formidable voice for the working class, laborers, small farmers, and
          youth. Education was a cause close to his heart, driving initiatives
          to improve educational facilities for the underprivileged. As Chief
          Minister, he implemented measures for senior citizens&apos; welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Democracy, debate, and discussion were integral to Karpoori Ji’s
          personality, evident in his involvement in the Quit India movement and
          resistance against the Emergency. His unique perspectives garnered
          admiration from leaders like JP, Dr Lohia, and Charan Singh Ji.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karpoori Thakur Ji&apos;s significant contribution to India included
          strengthening affirmative action for backward classes, challenging
          opposition to provide deserved representation and opportunities.
          Despite facing heavy resistance, he stood firm, implementing policies
          that laid the foundation for a more inclusive society. His lack of
          bitterness despite belonging to the most backward strata showcased
          true greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last decade, our government has followed in Karpoori Ji’s
          path, reflecting transformative empowerment in our schemes and
          policies. While social justice remained a mere political slogan for
          many, inspired by Karpoori Ji&apos;s vision, we implemented it as an
          effective governance model. Achievements, including uplifting 25 crore
          people from poverty and ensuring 100% coverage in various schemes,
          align with his commitment to social welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          The economic independence achieved through MUDRA Loans for
          entrepreneurs from OBC, SC, and ST communities fulfills Karpoori
          Thakur Ji’s vision. Our government extended reservations for SC, ST,
          and OBC, establishing the OBC Commission to work in line with Karpoori
          Ji&apos;s ideals. The PM-Vishwakarma Scheme promises prosperity for
          OBC communities across India.
        </p>
        <p>
          As someone from the backward classes, I owe much to Jan Nayak Karpoori
          Thakur Ji. Although he left us at the young age of 64, his legacy
          lives on in the hearts and minds of millions. He was truly a Jan
          Nayak!

          Movement (NAM) Summit in Uganda, highlighted the evolving global order
          and the crucial role of Africa&apos;s economic rise in reshaping it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jaishankar asserted that the rebalancing and reordering of the global
          order hinge on Africa&apos;s economic ascent. He stressed that for
          Africa to play its due role, it must not merely serve as a market or
          resource provider but actively participate in the global economic
          landscape. India, he affirmed, is placing its bets on Africa&apos;s
          rise, considering the continent&apos;s demographic potential, abundant
          resources, ambitious aspirations, and evolving policy alignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minister acknowledged the shared history and solidarity between
          India and Africa, underscoring the importance of Africa taking its
          rightful place in the changing global order for true multipolarity. He
          identified digital public infrastructure, green and clean growth,
          water, agricultural sustainability, security, and the blue economy as
          key areas for collaboration between India and Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jaishankar outlined the existing trade ties between India and Nigeria,
          with an annual trade value of USD 13 to 15 billion and India
          committing nearly USD 30 billion in investments. He urged stakeholders
          not to be complacent, emphasizing the untapped potential for increased
          trade between the two nations. Nigeria, he emphasized, holds a premier
          position as India&apos;s economic partner in Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Nigeria-India Joint Commission (NIJC) meeting, Jaishankar
          discussed the expansion of economic cooperation, highlighting
          opportunities in energy, power, renewables, transport, healthcare,
          fintech, agriculture, and security. The minister acknowledged the
          challenges faced by Nigerian students in visa renewals, and consular
          matters were addressed, seeking resolutions through diplomatic
          channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Lagos, Jaishankar spoke at the Nigerian Institute Of International
          Affairs (NIIA), emphasizing the importance of the Global South&apos;s
          advancement for planetary progress. He characterized the Global South
          as a mindset, solidarity, and self-reliance, emphasizing its role in
          promoting rebalancing and multipolarity on the global stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concluding his visit to Nigeria, Jaishankar expressed gratitude for
          the hospitality and affirmed his commitment to elevating India-Nigeria
          ties. He recognized the significant role of trade and investment in
          the partnership and commended those driving it forward.
