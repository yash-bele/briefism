          The U.S. and British militaries bombed over a dozen sites used by
          Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on Thursday. The massive
          retaliatory strike utilized warship and submarine missiles alongside
          fighter jets to target air defenses, drone and missile storage, and
          launching locations, officials said.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Biden stated the strikes demonstrated the U.S. and allies
          &quot;will not tolerate&quot; the militant group&apos;s relentless
          attacks on the Red Sea. Biden said they only acted after attempts at
          diplomacy and careful consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strikes directly responded to unprecedented Houthi attacks on
          international ships, including first-time use of anti-ship ballistic
          missiles, endangering personnel and trade, Biden explained. He added
          he will take further measures as needed to protect people and
          commerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Yemen&apos;s capital Sanaa, journalists heard four explosions early
          Friday local time. Residents in the port city of Hodeida said they
          heard five strong blasts. Witnesses also reported strikes in cities
          south of Sanaa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinated assault marked the first U.S. military response to the
          Houthis&apos; persistent attacks on commercial vessels since the
          Israel-Hamas war began. It came just a week after the U.S. and
          partners warned the Houthis to stop or risk potential military action.
          The warning briefly deterred attacks before the rebels&apos;
          largest-ever drone and missile barrage on shipping Tuesday, prompting
          U.S. and British ships to shoot down missiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials said after Tuesday&apos;s attacks, Biden met with advisors
          and directed the retaliatory strikes. The UK confirmed its Royal Air
          Force took part, with fighters from Cyprus. Allied nations joined the
          U.S. and UK in saying they won&apos;t hesitate to defend lives and
          commerce, though the aim is de-escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis vowed retaliation, warning any attack will spark a fierce
          response beyond imagination. Houthi-run media described strikes
          hitting bases, airports and camps. Casualties remain unclear.
          Officials don&apos;t expect the strikes will eliminate Houthi
          capabilities but may prompt retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Houthis say their attacks aim to stop Israel&apos;s war in Gaza.
          But their targets increasingly have little connection to Israel while
          imperiling a crucial Asia-Europe trade route. The UN Security Council
          passed a resolution Wednesday demanding the Houthis immediately halt
          attacks and implicitly condemned their Iranian weapons suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The broad coalition battling the Houthis shows the Biden
          administration&apos;s effort to avoid appearing unilateral. Multiple
          ships have already been struck despite a U.S.-led maritime mission to
          protect shipping. The U.S. long declined to signal when patience would
          run out before Wednesday&apos;s warning of consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reluctance reflected sensitivities about the shaky Yemen truce and
          worries about triggering wider regional conflict. But the
          attacks&apos; impact on shipping and escalation triggered the
          coalition warning. The strikes underscored using a united front rather
          than opening a new war front alone.

          An Ohio woman who was criminally charged for allegedly mishandling a
          home miscarriage will not be indicted, a grand jury decided on
          Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor&apos;s office in Trumbull County said the grand jury
          declined to charge Brittany Watts, 34, of Warren with abuse of a
          corpse. This resolved a controversial case that drew national
          attention for its implications for pregnant women as states enact new
          laws on reproductive healthcare access post - Roe v. Wade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision came just before around 150 supporters gathered for a
          rally supporting Watts in Warren&apos;s Courthouse Square. Watts
          addressed the crowd, thanking her community and declaring she will
          continue fighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watts&apos; attorney said an outpouring of public support helped her
          client endure being charged with a felony. The lawyer stated that
          despite how upsetting it sounds, Watts&apos; experience reflects the
          sad reality of miscarriage. They expressed relief and gratitude that
          the grand jury reached a just decision today.
        </p>
        <p>
          A municipal judge previously found probable cause against Watts.
          Prosecutors alleged she miscarried into a toilet, removed contents to
          outdoor trash, and left the 22-week fetus lodged in pipes. Records
          show her doctor advised hospital induction due to nonviable pregnancy
          and serious risks. But complications and delays prevented treatment.
          After miscarrying at home, she unsuccessfully tried going to a hair
          appointment before friends insisted she go to the hospital. A
          nurse&apos;s 911 call spurred the ensuing investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prosecutor argued the issue was not how or when the fetus died,
          but that Watts discarded it in the toilet, clogging it, and went about
          her day. An autopsy found the fetus died in utero with no recent
          injuries. Watts&apos; lawyer contended she had no criminal record and
          was being vilified for a common occurrence. The lawyer also questioned
          whether the abuse-of-corpse statute clearly defined terms like
          &quot;corpse&quot; and &quot;outrage&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          After binding the case over, the judge acknowledged better scholars
          should determine the fetus&apos;s precise legal status. Now, the
          prosecutor says further investigation found Watts committed no crime,
          despite disagreeing with the lower court&apos;s law application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Advocates expressed relief at the outcome, but warned Watts&apos; case
          exemplifies the threats Black women face for pregnancy outcomes amid
          abortion restrictions. They called for ending the criminalization of
          reproductive outcomes, which undermines rights and deters necessary
          care. Watts hopes her experience prompts change through education and
          legislation so no other woman endures similar trauma fighting for
          freedom.

          In a tragic example of a failed romantic relationship, a man in Mumbai
          killed his partner. Three months ago, the pair connected on social
          media. The incident happened in Navi Mumbai&apos;s Turbhe. The crime
          blurred the lines between revenge and love when a 24-year-old man
          named Shoaib Sheikh planned the 35-year-old bank manager Amit Kaur—a
          divorcee and mother of a teenage girl was killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story started a few months ago, when Shoaib and Amit connected on
          social media. When Shoaib arrived in Turbhe on January 8th to
          celebrate Kaur&apos;s birthday, what appeared to be a blossoming
          romance took a dark turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the details given by the police, it appears that Shoaib
          killed Amit Kaur by strangulation in a lodge where they were
          celebrating, driven by feelings of suspicion and grief. Shoaib left
          the scene after carrying out the horrific deed, leaving the staff to
          discover the woman&apos;s lifeless body when they opened the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shoaib Sheikh was taken into custody by the Sakinaka police in Mumbai
          after they carried out an investigation. After being arrested, the
          young man—who worked in a garage—finally admitted to the crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the police, Shoaib&apos;s misgivings about his lover
          ultimately motivated him to commit the murder. The victim, a
          well-liked bank manager, had no idea what evil plans had been
          simmering inside of Shoaib.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic event clarified the effects of a relationship poisoned by
          suspicion and deceit. The community was left reeling from the shocking
          reality that had descended upon them as the legal proceedings
          progressed and the dark secrets underlying this bizarre story of love
          and betrayal continued to come to light.

          The word &quot;Veg&quot; is clearly visible on the wrapper of her food
          packet in the pictures she posted, but the chicken pieces inside are
          also irresistible. The woman continued to tweet &quot;When I told the
          cabin supervisor (Sona), she apologized and told me that there were
          other complaints about the same issue besides mine and my

          Veera also appeared to be having trouble with the flight&apos;s
          takeoff delay. According to her, the AI582 flight was scheduled to
          depart at 6:40 p.m., but it was delayed by one hour. Her friend missed
          her train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad at 11 p.m. that night because of

          Air India has not yet responded to this incident, so Jain urged the

          (DGCA), and Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia to look into
          the situation.
