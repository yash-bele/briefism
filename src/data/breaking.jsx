          Microsoft has revealed that the same elite Russian hacking group
          responsible for the massive SolarWinds breach in 2020-2021 has
          recently targeted the technology giant in a new cyber espionage
          operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a January 2024 blog post, Microsoft said the incursion by the
          notorious state-sponsored Russian group dubbed Midnight Blizzard began
          in late November 2022 and was detected on January 12th. Only a small
          subset of Microsoft corporate accounts were breached, with some emails
          and attachments stolen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the compromised accounts were members of Microsoft’s senior
          leadership and staff in cybersecurity, legal, and other key units.
          Microsoft’s threat research team attributed the attack without doubt
          to Midnight Blizzard, known by researchers as APT29, Nobelium, or Cozy
          Bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team determined the primary motive was to gain intelligence on
          what Microsoft knew about the group&apos;s past and ongoing
          activities. The initial entry point was a “password spray attack” in
          November exploiting a Microsoft platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique involves trying a single compromised password across
          many related accounts to sneak into a target network. Microsoft stated
          no specific product or service vulnerability was exploited.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far there is no evidence the hackers accessed customer data,
          production systems, source code, or AI assets, the company emphasized.
          The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for
          comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Midnight Blizzard is linked to Russia&apos;s SVR foreign intelligence
          service according to U.S. officials. The elite hacker group is best
          known for infiltrating the Democratic National Committee before the
          2016 elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft software is ubiquitous across the U.S. government, and the
          company faced criticism last year when Chinese hackers stole senior
          State Department officials&apos; emails due to security practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before updating its threat naming in 2022, Microsoft called this same
          Russian group Nobelium. Cyber firm Mandiant dubs them Cozy Bear. In
          2021 Microsoft described the SolarWinds campaign as the most advanced
          nation-state cyberattack ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          It compromised over 100 private sector companies and government
          agencies in addition to US Justice and Treasury departments by
          hijacking widely-used network management software.
        </p>
        <p>
          This latest electronic intrusion highlights the constant threat posed
          by sophisticated, well-resourced nation-state hackers to all
          organizations according to Microsoft. It demonstrates Russia’s
          relentless drive to illegally acquire sensitive data for strategic
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the attack was detected and contained quickly, it underscores
          no entity is immune from targeting by groups like Midnight Blizzard
          with the backing of foreign governments. Continuous vigilance and
          proactive defense is required to protect institutional networks and
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft was specifically picked due to its visibility into
          cybersecurity threats and countermeasures. By understanding what and
          how much Microsoft knew about their past operations, the hackers could
          refine future tradecraft and targeting to avoid detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          This case illustrates the Spy vs. Spy nature of nation-state cyber
          espionage where major technology providers are both key targets and
          threats to avoid. It also shows no organization can afford to let its
          guard down against elite adversarial hacking given the stakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vigilance and resilience helped Microsoft detect and respond quickly
          to contain the latest Midnight Blizzard operation. But it remains a
          reminder that Russia-backed groups are actively looking to penetrate
          private and public sector networks to fulfill Kremlin intelligence
          priorities and agendas.

          The case of Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national accused by American
          authorities of involvement in a failed assassination plot, has taken a
          new turn. Gupta was arrested in Prague last June and the United States
          is seeking his extradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Czech judicial authorities, the Prague High Court has
          ruled that the Czech Republic can legally extradite Gupta to the US to
          face charges there. This judgment upholds an earlier decision by a
          lower Czech court permitting extradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charges against Gupta were filed in November 2022 by federal
          prosecutors in New York. He is accused of conspiring with an Indian
          government employee to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a separatist Sikh
          nationalist living in the United States. Pannun holds dual American
          and Canadian citizenship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alleged assassination plot was uncovered and prevented from being
          carried out. Gupta has been detained in the Czech Republic since his
          arrest while awaiting the outcome of extradition proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following standard protocol, the Prague High Court&apos;s ruling will
          now be forwarded to the Czech Justice Ministry along with the full
          case file. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek will make the final
          determination on whether Gupta can be extradited to America.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minister Blažek could potentially have doubts about the high
          court&apos;s decision, in which case he can ask the Supreme Court to
          review the matter within three months. But the timeframe for a final
          extradition decision remains uncertain.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a spokesperson, the requested person, Gupta, can be
          expected to exploit all available legal means to halt the extradition
          process. Earlier, Gupta&apos;s defense lawyer filed an appeal
          contesting his client&apos;s identity and arguing the case is
          politically motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The appeals court has now rejected that appeal, clearing the path for
          the justice minister to approve the extradition request. Gupta&apos;s
          attorney has suggested they may take the case to the Constitutional
          Court as a last resort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, the defense lawyer alleged human rights violations against
          Gupta in Czech custody, including extended solitary confinement. Court
          documents filed in January claimed Gupta was last in the United States
          in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          American authorities, however, believe Gupta worked with an Indian
          government employee to hatch the failed plot against Pannun sometime
          before his arrest last summer. The indictment alleges they conspired
          to kill Pannun on US soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case has generated interest given the intrigue surrounding the
          transnational assassination plot and the involvement of intelligence
          agencies. Gupta&apos;s ultimate fate now lies in the hands of Czech
          judicial authorities who will decide if the evidence merits
          extraditing him to stand trial in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          This new development marks the latest twist in an ongoing legal saga
          playing out across multiple countries. The final chapter remains
          uncertain, but progress has been made towards potentially extraditing
          Gupta to face charges relating to the alleged murder conspiracy.

          Earlier reports said airspace restrictions would be in effect until
          Republic Day and again on January 29th for the Beating Retreat
          ceremony. Delhi airport will also be completely shut from 6am to 9pm
          on R-Day itself as per the NOTAM. However, the restrictions will not
          impact helicopter operations of the Air Force, Army, BSF or aircraft
          ferrying state Governors/Chief Ministers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The partial shutdown of one of the world&apos;s busiest airports is an
          annual measure taken amid heightened security prior to R-Day
          celebrations. Coming after weeks of fog-related flight delays,
          diversions and cancellations, the 145-minute daily closure could
          further disrupt airlines&apos; schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaotic scenes were witnessed recently due to extreme fog, including
          the shocking assault of an IndiGo pilot by a frustrated passenger
          after a 13-hour delay on a Delhi-Goa flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia announced a 6-point plan this
          week to mitigate fog disruptions, including new SOPs for airlines and
          setting up &apos;war rooms&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          India will celebrate its 75th R-Day on January 26th with French
          President Emmanuel Macron as Chief Guest. This will be the 6th time a
          French leader has been accorded the honour.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of security measures, Delhi Police has banned paragliders,
          hang gliders, microlights, drones, balloons and other flying objects
          till February 15th. Para jumping or parachuting is also prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          The East District division held a mock anti-terror drill at Akshardham
          Temple to evaluate readiness to handle diverse crises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The R-Day restrictions aim to secure airspace in the capital during
          the high-profile event and are as per protocol. However, authorities
          must balance security with minimal impact on the public and air
          travellers. The recent fog chaos has highlighted the urgent need to
          upgrade aviation infrastructure and technology to make operations
          all-weather resistant.
        </p>
        <p>
          R-Day celebrates India&apos;s democratic spirit amidst tightened
          security and restrictions. But citizens must retain liberty, mobility
          and convenience to the extent possible rather than be subjected to
          overzealous curtailments each year. Collaborative measures between
          security forces, airports and airlines can enhance safeguards while
          ensuring smooth operations and services.

          Chants and prayers filled the air as the Ram Lalla idol was
          respectfully placed in the inner sanctum. Consecration rituals
          commenced on January 12th. Sources say PM Modi will perform the Pran
          Pratishtha puja on the 23rd to complete the consecration rites.
        </p>
        <p>
          A team of priests led by Lakshmikant Dixit will perform the main Pran
          Pratishtha rituals. PM Modi is strictly adhering to prescribed rules
          ahead of his participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sources share that the PM is sleeping on the floor with just a
          blanket, only drinking coconut water. He has asked the public not to
          visit Ayodhya on the 22nd to avoid inconveniencing Lord Ram,
          suggesting they come from the 23rd onwards instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          PM Modi also called on every Indian household to light a diya on
          January 22nd to be part of the ceremony spiritually. Over 11,000
          specially invited guests from India and abroad will physically attend
          the momentous event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idol&apos;s installation marks a key milestone in the
          temple&apos;s construction. The consecration rites will imbue the
          deity with divine presence. PM Modi&apos;s observance of preparatory
          rituals reflects his commitment to tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          His appeal to celebrate nationally with diyas rather than crowding
          Ayodhya demonstrates thoughtful leadership upholding Lord Ram&apos;s
          ideals. The grand temple&apos;s consecration will be a historic
          moment, fulfilling devotees&apos; centuries-long wait to offer worship
          there.

          Last week, the Hyderabad police made a major bust by arresting Rakesh
          Jain and Mahaveer Jain for illegally manufacturing and selling
          counterfeit Mysore Sandal soaps. This fraudulent operation had been
          running for nearly a decade across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and the
          Hyderabad-Karnataka region, causing estimated losses of Rs 500-600
          crore to the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL) - the
          legitimate producer of Mysore Sandal soap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tip-off came from an anonymous message received by Karnataka
          Industries Minister M B Patil, who also chairs the KSDL. Acting on
          this lead, KSDL staff in Secunderabad purchased over Rs 5 lakh worth
          of fake soaps for testing, proving they were counterfeit. However,
          details on the manufacturers remained scant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cunning plan was hatched - a large Rs 25 lakh order was placed for
          the fake soaps as a pretense for visiting the secret manufacturing
          facility. This enabled the perpetrators to finally be identified and
          arrested. Investigations suggest the counterfeit operation
          specifically targeted religious events and tourist destinations where
          buyers may be less discerning about product authenticity. With
          estimated annual turnover of Rs 60 crore, it was a highly lucrative
          business built on deceit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scam worked by offering retailers substantially higher commissions
          than the genuine product, creating strong financial incentives to
          peddle the fake soaps. A 75g bar of real Mysore Sandal soap earns
          retailers minimal margin, but the counterfeits were sold at less than
          half price, generating huge profits. Similarly, boxes of 3 x 450g
          genuine soaps provide Rs 10 margin, but the fakes offered Rs 50 - a
          five-fold increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lab tests by KSDL revealed the counterfeit soaps contained dangerous
          heavy metals that could cause cancer. Genuine boxes have holograms, so
          lack of this security feature is a clear visual indicator of fakes.
          The criminals had exploited relaxed scrutiny of brands at religious
          fairs and festivals to pass off the hazardous products.
        </p>
        <p>
          A political angle also emerged, with allegations that the Jain
          brothers had links to local BJP leaders Manikant Rathod and Vittal
          Nayak. Photographs showing the accused with UP CM Yogi Adityanath and
          Telangana BJP MLA Raja Singh were revealed by Minister Priyank Kharge
          at a press conference. However, the BJP leaders strongly denied any
          connection to the crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, a KSDL corruption scandal surfaced last year when
          former BJP MLA and KSDL chairman Madal Virupakshappa&apos;s son
          Prashanth was caught collecting bribes for supply contracts. A raid on
          his premises uncovered a massive Rs 8.20 crore of unaccounted cash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent arrests prove more work is required to tackle the
          counterfeit trade which allows unscrupulous businesses to profit
          through deception and potentially harm public health. Tougher
          penalties and consumer education may help, but eliminating corrupt
          political connections will be key to effectively shutting down these
          dangerous fake networks for good.

          Police in Kerala arrested a 59-year-old Pentecostal pastor on Friday
          for the alleged sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy. The incident
          occurred this past Wednesday in a district in the southern region of
          the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to authorities, the pastor allegedly lured the vulnerable
          minor into a trap and sexually abused him. The young boy had been
          abandoned by his mother and was waiting for his grandmother, who had
          gone to the hospital, when the pastor approached him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identified as Raveendranath, the pastor invited the boy to his home
          after gaining his trust. At the residence, the pastor allegedly served
          the child cake before showing him pornographic images on a tablet
          device. Raveendranath then sexually assaulted the boy, as per the
          police complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accused has been booked under the Protection of Children from
          Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act based on the child&apos;s testimony. This
          law aims to deter and punish sexual crimes against minors.
        </p>
        <p>
          After being arrested, Raveendranath was produced before a magistrate
          who ordered he be placed in judicial custody pending trial. As the
          allegations involve abuse of a child who had been abandoned, the
          police will be investigating whether the pastor identified and
          targeted the vulnerable boy in a predatory manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith leaders wielding influence over followers and having
          unsupervised access to minors must uphold the highest moral and
          ethical standards. This duty becomes even more onerous when engaging
          with children who lack parental care or support networks. Violating
          this trust can leave deep emotional and psychological scars, as
          evidenced by numerous cases of clergy abuse worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authorities have stated that the mental health and safety of the
          survivor are the primary concerns during trial, and counselling will
          be provided if required. The community must also reflect on how to
          prevent such exploitation of society&apos;s most vulnerable members.

          A shocking case of road rage occurred in Delhi&apos;s Janakpuri area
          on Wednesday morning, where a 22-year-old man was shot and injured by
          two men after his car accidentally brushed against their motorcycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to police reports, the victim, Jatin Jain, was with a female
          friend when the incident took place. While parking his car near a
          district center, it slightly collided with a motorcycle belonging to
          the two accused men. An intense argument broke out between Jain and
          the men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, when Jain and his friend crossed the road on her scooter, the
          accused allegedly followed them and demanded they stop. Another heated
          exchange occurred, after which one of the men pulled out a pistol and
          fired at Jain, with the bullet striking his left hip. Jain&apos;s
          friend fortunately escaped unharmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the accused, identified as Vishal Rai, was arrested at the
          scene by a nearby police patrol that rushed over after hearing the
          gunshot. However, Rai&apos;s associate managed to flee initially and
          was absconding.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Vichitra Veer,
          locals also hurried to help the injured Jain as his friend screamed
          for assistance, providing cover from the hostile men. Police recovered
          the pistol used in the attack from the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials revealed Rai has a criminal background with over eight prior
          cases related to arms and ammunition, theft, and robbery charges. The
          injured Jain was transported to a hospital for treatment, while police
          registered a case of attempted murder.

        </p>
        <p>
          A bench headed by Justice BV Nagarathna, before whom the pleas were
          mentioned, directed the registry to get orders from the Chief Justice
          of India DY Chandrachud for reconstituting the original bench that
          heard the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original case was decided by Justices Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan.
          However, Justice Nagarathna was sitting with Justice Sanjay Karol on
          Thursday.

          On January 8, the Supreme Court had quashed the remission granted to
          the 11 convicts by the Gujarat government. The court had ordered them
          to surrender to jail authorities within two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the January 21 deadline approaching, three convicts have now
          moved the Supreme Court seeking more time to surrender, citing
          personal reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Thursday, their counsel urged the court to list the matter on
          Friday, January 19 given the looming deadline. The counsel added that
          though only three pleas have been filed currently, more may be
          submitted during the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The court agreed to their request in view of the deadline. Justice
          Nagarathna&apos;s bench directed the registry to get orders from the
          CJI to reconstitute the original bench that heard the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The court said the listing is required urgently since the surrender
          deadline expires on January 21, 2024.

          A 37-year-old woman is in trouble with the Delhi Police for allegedly
          deceiving a five-star hotel in Aerocity by staying in a suite for two
          weeks, faking UPI payments amounting to Rs 5-7 lakh, and attempting to
          leave without settling her bills. The incident occurred at Pullman
          Hotel, and the accused, hailing from Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, is
          now under police scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman arrived in Delhi alone on December 30 to celebrate New
          Year&apos;s Eve and checked into the hotel. During her stay until
          January 13, she reportedly utilized the spa and other amenities,
          incurring an additional cost of Rs 2.11 lakh. To avoid being linked to
          the charges, she allegedly used a fake name when availing these
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FIR, filed on January 13 based on the complaint of a Pullman Hotel
          staff member, reveals that the woman was evasive during police
          questioning. Initially claiming to be a lawyer, suspicions arose about
          her actual occupation, with an officer suggesting she may run a gift
          shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman purportedly attempted to feign payment for the services
          using fake UPI receipts. She showcased transactions on a bank&apos;s
          UPI mobile application, but upon verification, it was revealed that
          the bank had not received any payment. The investigation also
          disclosed that she had utilized the hotel&apos;s spa and fitness
          center under a false identity, accumulating services worth Rs 2.11
          lakh. The FIR alleges that when confronted about the fraudulent bank
          transactions, she hesitated to present the actual bank statement and
          later tried to escape with her bags from the hotel lobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon being stopped by the hotel&apos;s security staff, she reportedly
          engaged in aggressive behavior, including scratching and abusing the
          staff. The police were called, and she was taken to the IGI Airport
          police station, where she was questioned and a case of cheating was
          registered against her.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the accused has been granted bail due to the bailable nature of
          the charges, the police are now collaborating with Andhra Pradesh
          authorities to gather information about her job, profile, and any
          potential criminal history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel staff was reportedly deceived for over two weeks as the
          woman presented different UPI and bank transaction receipts, and it
          took some time for the staff to scrutinize the bills and confront her.
          The Indian Express reached out to the Pullman Hotel front desk and the
          complainant for their response, which is awaited.
