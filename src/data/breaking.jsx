          Four months after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&apos;s
          assertion of a potential Indian connection to the killing of Khalistan
          separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar stirred diplomatic tensions, a senior
          Canadian official has revealed that India is actively cooperating with
          Canada to address the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canada&apos;s outgoing National Security Advisor, Jody Thomas, who
          retired after more than 35 years of public service, stated in an
          interview with Canadian news channel CTV that discussions with Indian
          counterparts have been productive, indicating progress in bilateral
          relations. She noted that India&apos;s collaboration with Canada in
          resolving the matter has improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas attributed the improved ties between Canada and India partly to
          the US indictment of Indian citizen Nikhil Gupta in an alleged plot to
          assassinate Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. She
          emphasized the significance of fostering a healthy relationship with
          India for Canada&apos;s engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Appointed as National Security and Intelligence Advisor to Prime
          Minister Trudeau in January 2022, Thomas has engaged in discussions on
          the Nijjar case with Indian NSA Ajit Doval since August 2023,
          including during the G20 Summit in Delhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian government has not officially responded to Thomas&apos;s
          statements. Diplomatic relations between the two countries soured
          following Trudeau&apos;s remarks in September 2023, alleging potential
          Indian involvement in Nijjar&apos;s killing. India refuted any
          government involvement, dismissing Trudeau&apos;s allegations as
          baseless.
        </p>
        <p>
          India&apos;s response to allegations by the US regarding a plot to
          target Khalistan separatists differed from its approach to Canada.
          While India initiated an inquiry committee in response to US
          allegations, it maintained that Canada did not provide specific
          evidence or inputs necessitating similar action.
        </p>
        <p>
          External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar clarified in Parliament that
          India&apos;s response varied based on the provision of inputs. He
          explained that while the US shared information, prompting an inquiry,
          Canada did not provide such evidence, hence precluding equitable
          treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prime Minister Narendra Modi echoed this sentiment in an interview
          with the Financial Times, emphasizing India&apos;s commitment to the
          rule of law and readiness to address any information provided
          regarding its citizens&apos; actions, whether positive or negative.

          At approximately 5 pm on Friday, Radhika, a 16-year-old resident of
          Shahdara&apos;s Mansarovar Park, had just returned from her tuition
          when she heard the doorbell of her third-floor flat. Upon opening the
          door, she was met by Rachna, her neighbor from the second floor, who
          was shouting about a fire and observed thick black smoke filling the
          staircase. &quot;I panicked and urged my brother Pratham and mother to
          descend the stairs, but the smoke made it impossible to see or
          breathe,&quot; Radhika recounted to The Indian Express.

        <p>
          Finding refuge on the balcony, Radhika wrapped a cloth around her
          mouth from the clothesline. &quot;I stayed there, desperately calling
          out to my family, but I couldn&apos;t perceive their presence.
          Firefighters eventually arrived and rescued me,&quot; she added.
          Tragically, her 40-year-old mother Gauri and 17-year-old brother
          perished in the blaze, along with Rachna (28) and her nine-month-old
          daughter Ruhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suffering burns on her arms and legs, Radhika was discharged from GTB
          Hospital the following day. She revealed that her brother had
          aspirations of pursuing a career in chartered accountancy after
          completing his twelfth grade. &quot;My father, Ashutosh, was away for
          a wedding... I wish my mother and brother could have been saved,&quot;
          Radhika lamented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither Rachna&apos;s husband nor the occupants of the fourth floor
          were present during the incident. Subsequently, the Delhi Police
          arrested the building landlord, 75-year-old Bharat Singh Chauhan, and
          his son, 25-year-old Mohit Chauhan, for operating a godown in the
          stilt parking area where fiber sheets and wipers were stored,
          obstructing the only staircase.
        </p>
        <p>
          DCP (Shahdara) Surendra Choudhary stated, &quot;They have been
          arrested for causing the death of the four persons due to their
          negligence and have been booked under IPC section 304A (causing death
          by negligence)... they used to dump their factory material near the
          stairs and turned the whole ground floor into a godown... prima facie,
          a short circuit occurred and the fire spread rapidly through the
          plastic material.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Delhi Fire Services Chief Atul Garg reported that the fire originated
          among the wipers, rubber, and cutting machine. The landlord&apos;s
          wife, 70-year-old Prabhawati, sustained burn injuries on her leg and
          was discharged the following day.

          Champion trap shooter Preeti Rajak made history on Saturday by
          becoming the first woman to attain the rank of subedar in the Army,
          following her promotion from the havildar rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          This marks a significant milestone as it is the first instance of a
          female Army soldier rising to the position of junior commissioned
          officer (JCO) since the Army extended opportunities to women in the
          Corps of Military Police (CMP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Subedar Rajak joined the Army (CMP) on December 22, 2022, based on her
          exceptional performance in trap shooting. She stands as the inaugural
          meritorious sportswoman in the shooting discipline to be enlisted in
          the Army as a havildar, as per the Army&apos;s announcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, women are not appointed to other ranks in various arms and
          services of the Army. However, women enthusiasts aspiring to join the
          Army can enlist in the CMP.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 19th Asian Games in 2022, held in Hangzhou, China, Sub
          Rajak clinched a silver medal in the women’s trap team event. Her
          outstanding performance led to her receiving an exceptional
          out-of-turn promotion. Typically, soldiers ascend to JCO ranks after
          successfully navigating their promotion cadres and junior leaders’
          proficiency tests over 18-20 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Army expressed confidence that Rajak&apos;s accomplishments would
          inspire future generations of young women to both join the Indian Army
          and excel in professional shooting. Lieutenant General Gajendra Joshi,
          Commandant of Infantry School, presided over the pipping ceremony,
          according to the Army statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a separate development, Padmashri and Arjuna awardee Subedar Major
          and Honorary Lieutenant Jitu Rai were elevated to the rank of Subedar
          Major and Honorary Captain in recognition of their distinguished
          services, as per the Army&apos;s announcement.

          External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met with Texas Governor Greg
          Abbott, expressing admiration for his dedication to fostering stronger
          ties between India and the US and acknowledging Texas&apos;s role in
          advancing this relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abbott&apos;s visit to India occurs amid tensions between his
          administration and the Biden government regarding illegal immigration
          along the US-Mexico border. Disputes over border control have
          escalated, with Abbott defying federal directives and the US Supreme
          Court&apos;s rulings by ordering additional razor wire installations
          to deter migration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite a recent Supreme Court decision favoring federal authority
          over border measures, Abbott, known for his hard-right stance,
          persists in his efforts to fortify sections of the US-Mexico border.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following their meeting, Jaishankar praised Abbott&apos;s commitment
          to bolstering India-US ties, expressing confidence in the success of
          his mission to India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abbott is leading an economic development mission to India aimed at
          promoting Texas&apos;s economy, fostering trade, job creation, and
          investment opportunities for Indian companies in Texas, and
          strengthening the partnership between India and Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his visit, Abbott met with Union Minister of Commerce and
          Industry Piyush Goyal to enhance economic cooperation, particularly in
          information technology, engineering, and research sectors. Texas,
          renowned for its business-friendly environment and skilled workforce,
          offers substantial prospects for global partnerships, including with
          India.
        </p>
        <p>
          India ranks ninth globally in terms of foreign direct investment
          projects in Texas, with significant capital investment and job
          creation attributed to Indian companies. In the past decade, Indian
          investments in Texas have surpassed $1.4 billion, generating over
          10,300 jobs. Bilateral trade between Texas and India amounted to $20.4
          billion in 2022, with Texas exports totaling $13.3 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his trip, Governor Abbott and the Texas delegation engaged with
          prominent business leaders, including Gautam Adani of the Adani Group,
          Rahul Singh of HCL Tech, and Rajesh Nambiar of NASSCOM, highlighting
          the potential for further collaboration and investment between Texas
          and India.

          The Ranchhodji temple&apos;s 150-year-old cannon, located on MG Road
          in Vadodara, underwent a test firing at Navlakhi Ground on Saturday,
          as directed by a civil court. Temple trustees filed a petition seeking
          permission to resume the tradition of firing the cannon during Dev
          Diwali, which ceased in 1996 due to safety concerns and official
          intervention. The cannon, transported from the temple to Navlakhi
          Ground, underwent inspection by a team of experts appointed by the
          civil court, including district administration officials, police
          personnel, lawyers, and forensic experts.

        <p>
          Under police supervision, temple trustees, accompanied by about 100
          devotees, transported the brass cannon to Navlakhi Ground in
          compliance with the conditions outlined in the granted police
          permission. Court-appointed advocates oversaw the process, along with
          police officials who provided security. Following the test firing,
          which propelled the cannon approximately 46 feet, experts noted minor
          gunpowder dispersion but no other dislodgement or scattering. The
          report will be submitted to the court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cannonballs for the test were legally procured from Porbandar,
          following due process. The exercise stemmed from a directive of the
          Vadodara civil court, amid ongoing litigation between the
          temple&apos;s chief priest, Janardhan Dave, and authorities since
          1996. The cannon was seized by the District Collector after two
          individuals allegedly sustained injuries during the 1995 Dev Diwali
          procession. Despite its return to the temple, firing during subsequent
          Dev Diwali processions was prohibited due to safety concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent court order mandated the cannon&apos;s test, with experts
          tasked to submit a report for the court&apos;s consideration on
          January 30. Dave, expressing satisfaction with the test results,
          remains hopeful for a favorable court decision, ending his vow to walk
          barefoot until the ban is lifted. Approximately 1.5 kg of ammunition
          was used for the test, resulting in nine explosions at Navlakhi
          Ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dave revealed that the cannon, dating back about 180 years, underwent
          previous tests in 2000 and 2010. If the court rules in favor, the
          temple plans to seek permission for a victory procession and
          anticipates resuming the cannon firing tradition during the next Dev
          Diwali after 29 years.

          In August of the previous year, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, on
          the brink of unveiling a significant financial package for chess in
          the UK, extended an invitation to two young chess prodigies to 10
          Downing Street. These prodigies were eight-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan
          and 14-year-old Shreyas Royal, both British citizens of Indian origin,
          akin to Sunak himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite India gaining prominence as a hub of young chess talents
          during the pandemic, these Indian-origin prodigies have carved out a
          niche for themselves in England. Bodhana secured victory in the
          under-8 category at the World Cadet Championship last year, also
          holding the title of World Youth Champion and presently holding the
          30th rank in England&apos;s women&apos;s category. Shreyas currently
          stands at the 19th position among active players in England.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the span of two months, Bodhana achieved notable victories
          against three International Masters, including Lorin D&apos;Costa at
          the European Blitz Championship in Zagreb and Lela Javakhishvili and
          Nurgyul Salimova at the European Women&apos;s Blitz Championship in
          Monaco. Shreyas also made waves at the London Chess tournament in
          December 2023, defeating GM Jules Moussard and drawing with players
          like India&apos;s Gukesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          While both Bodhana and Shreyas hold British citizenship, their
          families are first-generation migrants. Bodhana&apos;s parents lived
          in Tamil Nadu&apos;s Trichy, while Shreyas was born in Bengaluru.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bodhana&apos;s father, Sivanandan Velayutham, revealed that they moved
          to the UK in 2007 as economic migrants. Bodhana, born and raised in
          London, started playing chess at the age of five, stumbling upon a
          chess board at home. Initially, her father, with limited knowledge of
          chess, downloaded Chess.com to help her learn by watching videos.
          Despite initially considering it a passing interest, Bodhana continued
          playing and soon began winning medals and trophies from online
          tournaments.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Bodhana receives acclaim in the chess community for her
          achievements, her parents remain cautious about ensuring she stays
          grounded. With a current rating of 1856, she still has a long way to
          go to achieve the 2500 rating required for the Grandmaster title.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a school student in London&apos;s Harrow, Bodhana faces time
          constraints and cannot fully immerse herself in chess like Indian GMs
          did early in their careers. On weekdays, she dedicates about an hour
          to chess, with additional time spent on weekends for practice and

          Shreyas, at Bodhana&apos;s age, gained attention in England due to his
          exceptional chess talent. His father, Jitendra, shared that their plan
          to move to Norway was halted when the chess community in the UK
          lobbied British MPs to allow Shreyas to stay due to his talent. The UK
          Home Secretary Sajid Javid agreed to adjust visa norms, enabling
          Shreyas to remain in England.

          Shreyas spends five to six hours daily on chess, coming close to
          earning the Grandmaster title. He remains optimistic about overcoming
          the final hurdles and acknowledges that while playing for England
          might be a loss for India, the country already boasts numerous chess
          prodigies.

          The surge in war risk insurance premiums for cargo ships has been
          prompted by the tense situation in the Red Sea, leading several
          insurance companies to hesitate in covering cargo voyages through the
          region.
        </p>
        <p>
          War risk premiums, which initially rose from 0.05% to 0.7% in early
          December, spiked to one percent of the ship&apos;s value approximately
          a week ago. For instance, if a ship is valued at $200 million, the
          corresponding premium for shipping firms would be $2 million.
          Insurance officials in Mumbai anticipate further increases if the
          situation escalates.

          Saurabh Verma, Managing Director of Global Insurance Brokers,
          explained that the Red Sea scenario falls under the war risk category
          for marine insurance. The Joint War Committee in London monitors
          geopolitics and determines insurance rates based on their assessments.
          In a warlike situation, such as the one in the Red Sea, reinsurance is
          assessed to cover war or similar perils, leading to adjustments in
          premium rates based on changes in risk levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent attacks in the Red Sea have tripled marine insurance rates for
          war risks, and tanker forward freight agreements are trading higher
          due to elevated shipping risks, according to S&P Global.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some insurance companies are now reluctant to cover cargo on voyages
          through the Red Sea route, aiming to avoid the risk of high-value
          claims. There are reports of insurers retracting existing policies for
          shipments in high-risk areas, providing a 30-day notice option for
          both parties involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Houthi rebels have targeted vessels suspected of links to Israel in
          the Red Sea, prompting the Joint War Committee to extend the Red Sea
          war risk territory. The London insurance market now classifies the
          southern Red Sea as a high-risk area, requiring ships to notify
          insurers when sailing through and pay additional premiums for a
          seven-day cover period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysts predict a further rise in transportation costs in the region,
          with increased insurance premiums contributing to higher expenses. The
          perceived risk may lead vessels to bypass the region, opting for
          longer routes like circumnavigating the Horn of Africa. However, this
          would elevate cargo costs, contributing to price increases during a
          period when countries such as India and the United States are trying
          to control inflation.

          Sobel Network Shipping Co notes that ships sailing under the Bahamas
          flag registry have been targets in various attacks. The Bahamas
          delegation characterized the situation as a &quot;deliberate attack on
          international shipping&quot; in a crucial region.

          Fitch Ratings highlights that about 12% of global oil seaborne trade
          in the first half of 2023 relied on total oil shipments via the Suez
          Canal, the SUMED pipeline, and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. Attacks by
          Houthi rebels have concentrated primarily in the narrow Bab-el-Mandeb
          Strait. Some major shippers, including BP, Shell, and QatarEnergy,
          have halted transit through the Suez Canal, rerouting around Africa,
          temporarily tightening oil and gas markets. The alternative route,
          taking about a fortnight longer, is not expected to have a significant
          impact on prices.
