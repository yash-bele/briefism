          GOP Presidential hopeful Nikki Haley encountered an unexpected moment
          during a rally in New Hampshire on Monday when a supporter of Donald
          Trump disrupted her speech with an impromptu marriage proposal. The
          incident took place at the Artisan Hotel in Salem, where the
          52-year-old presidential contender was addressing her supporters about
          the significance of the upcoming election on the eve of the New
          Hampshire primary.
        </p>
        <p>
          While discussing key election issues, a man from the crowd interrupted
          Haley with the question, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; The
          unanticipated proposal elicited laughter from the audience, including
          Haley herself. Responding in a composed manner, the former South
          Carolina governor, who is already married to Maj. Michael Haley,
          countered by asking the man if he would vote for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a brief pause, the man declared his allegiance to Trump, drawing
          disapproval from fellow rally attendees. Unfazed by the response,
          Haley straightforwardly told the man to &quot;get out,&quot;
          expressing her displeasure at the interruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, in the New Hampshire presidential primary held the
          following day, Haley secured the second position after former US
          President Donald Trump. Trump emerged victorious in the Republican
          presidential primary, consolidating his position as the leading
          candidate for the Republican Party. Despite not actively campaigning,
          current US President Joe Biden secured the win for the Democrats in
          New Hampshire.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Trump&apos;s consecutive wins, he began to solidify his standing
          as the frontrunner for the Republican Presidential candidacy, shaping
          the political landscape leading up to the election.

          In the recent New Hampshire primaries, former US President Donald
          Trump secured a victory in the Republican presidential primary,
          marking his second consecutive win after Iowa. Despite not actively
          campaigning, current US President Joe Biden emerged victorious for the
          Democrats, positioning both leaders for a potential rematch in the
          November 2024 presidential election.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Trump&apos;s win in Iowa and New Hampshire, a re-match with his
          Democratic counterpart, Biden, becomes increasingly likely. Former
          South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, a rival to Trump, aimed to
          disrupt the political landscape in the crucial state but ultimately
          finished second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edison Research reported that Trump secured 52.3% of the vote compared
          to Haley&apos;s 46.6% after tallying 14% of the votes, according to
          Reuters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden&apos;s win in the New Hampshire Democratic primary, achieved as
          a write-in candidate without campaigning or appearing on the ballot,
          defied party rules, as the primary in the key state preceded South
          Carolina&apos;s, according to the Associated Press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump&apos;s victories in Iowa and New Hampshire marked the first time
          a Republican accomplished a sweep in these states since 1976, setting
          the stage for the top candidates to contend for the White House.
        </p>
        <p>
          The New Hampshire primary witnessed the first one-on-one faceoff
          between Trump and Haley after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, initially
          considered Trump&apos;s challenger, withdrew and endorsed the former
          president.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the setback in New Hampshire, Haley is determined to mount a
          robust challenge in the upcoming primary in her home state, South
          Carolina, scheduled for February 24. Previously finishing third in
          Iowa, Haley is anticipated to present a formidable opposition,
          possibly offering a chance to defeat Trump and secure a state victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, despite Trump&apos;s success in New Hampshire, exit polls
          indicate potential challenges in his election campaign. Facing
          multiple criminal charges, including attempts to overturn the 2020
          election and payments to an adult star for silence, Trump may
          encounter obstacles. Edison&apos;s exit poll revealed that nearly half
          of Republican primary voters questioned Trump&apos;s fitness to serve
          if convicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, while Edison predicted Biden&apos;s triumph in the New
          Hampshire Democratic primary, over two-thirds of Republican primary
          voters expressed dissatisfaction with the American economy, citing it
          as either poor or not good, according to Reuters.

          On Tuesday, a Pakistani court reinstated the bail of former Prime
          Minister Imran Khan in seven cases related to the May 9 violence on
          military installations. The Lahore High Court&apos;s decision may not
          offer respite to the 71-year-old leader of the Pakistan
          Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) ahead of the upcoming general polls on February
          8.
        </p>
        <p>
          This legal development follows the Supreme Court of Pakistan&apos;s
          January 13 decision to strip the PTI of its signature cricket
          &apos;bat&apos; election symbol. Consequently, individuals contesting
          elections under the PTI banner must now run as independent candidates.
          The election commission of Pakistan has already rejected nomination
          papers for Khan and several of his party associates.
        </p>
        <p>
          A two-judge bench comprising Justice Aalia Neelum and Justice Farooq
          Haider at the Lahore High Court heard Khan&apos;s petition challenging
          the Anti-Terrorism Court&apos;s (ATC) decision to dismiss his
          pre-arrest bail petitions in the May 9 cases. This dismissal occurred
          subsequent to Khan&apos;s arrest and conviction in the Toshakhana
          case, related to the national treasury gifts.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Tuesday&apos;s hearing, Khan&apos;s counsel, Barrister Salman
          Safdar, argued that the trial court had wrongfully dismissed his
          client&apos;s bail petitions in his absence, citing imprisonment as
          the reason for non-appearance. Safdar contended that Imran Khan, being
          incarcerated at the time, should have been summoned from jail before
          the trial court made decisions on his bail petitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safdar urged the court to overturn the trial court&apos;s order and
          instruct it to evaluate the bail petition based on its merits. Law
          officer Farhad Ali Shah opposed the petition, asserting that the trial
          court had correctly dismissed Imran Khan&apos;s bail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to expectations, the bench delivered a verdict in favor of
          Khan, restoring his pre-arrest bail petitions. Additionally, the
          Lahore High Court directed the trial court to register Khan&apos;s
          attendance via video link from jail and evaluate his bail petitions on
          their merits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Anti-Terrorism Court had previously dismissed Khan&apos;s
          pre-arrest bail in seven cases linked to the May 9 riots, including
          attacks on the Lahore Corps Commander’s House. On that day, PTI
          supporters vandalized numerous military installations, such as the
          Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase, and the
          ISI building in Faisalabad. The incident marked the first time the mob
          attacked the Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imran Khan contends that the May 9 violence targeted his party and
          alleges a conspiracy outlined in the &apos;London agreement,&apos;
          suggesting that the powerful Pakistan Army is favoring Pakistan Muslim
          League-Nawaz (PML-N) chief Nawaz Sharif.

          A team from the Enforcement Directorate has arrived at the residence
          of Shahjahan Sheikh, a Trinamool Congress leader in Sandeshkhali, West
          Bengal, for a new series of raids related to an alleged ration
          distribution scam. The central agency is conducting the raids with
          heightened security, including the presence of one company of the
          CRPF, and has deployed over 24 cars for the operation. Local police
          are also on the scene to provide assistance during the raids.
        </p>
        <p>
          This comes after a previous incident on January 5, when several
          members of the Enforcement Directorate were attacked by a mob in
          Sandeshkhali while en route to Shahjahan&apos;s residence for raids.
          More than 200 locals surrounded the officials&apos; vehicles and
          vandalized them. In connection with this attack, four individuals have
          been arrested from Basirhat, a town in North 24 Parganas, based on
          surveillance footage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bengal Police initiated three FIRs related to the incident,
          including one filed by locals alleging that Enforcement Directorate
          officials were causing disturbances. The Calcutta High Court
          subsequently issued a stay on the police investigation against the
          probe agency officials until March 31.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, another Trinamool Congress leader, Shankar Adhya, former
          Bongaon Municipality Chairman and a co-accused in the alleged ration
          distribution scam, was arrested earlier this month. He was taken into
          Enforcement Directorate custody following searches at his residence in
          Simultola, Bongaon, and properties associated with him and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Shankar Adhya&apos;s hearing, the Enforcement Directorate
          claimed widespread corruption amounting to at least Rs 10,000 crore in
          the ration distribution scam. The agency further alleged that
          approximately Rs 2,000 crore of this sum was illegally funneled to
          Dubai through Shankar Adhya&apos;s company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The involvement of Shankar Adhya came to light through a letter from
          the arrested former Bengal Food Minister, Jyotipriya Mallick, who is
          also implicated in the ration corruption case, according to the probe
          agency.

          Australian High Commissioner to India, Philip Green, expressed his
          perspective on the evolving strategic partnership between India and
          Australia, noting the emergence of a &quot;more confident India.&quot;
          Green welcomed this development, emphasizing the substantial
          cooperation expected between the two nations in the coming years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his first interview with India Today, Green highlighted the shift
          from occasional senior officials&apos; meetings with no fixed agenda
          to now having annual leaders&apos; meetings, structured agendas, and
          dedicated working groups addressing issues systematically. Reflecting
          on the past four to five years, he underscored the significant
          development of the Quad, describing it as a dramatic transformation in
          the regional dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green echoed External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar&apos;s recent
          statement that &quot;India today is much more confident than
          before.&quot; Regarding the Khalistan issue, he reiterated
          Australia&apos;s support for the democratic right to peaceful protest
          while emphasizing the commitment to safeguarding the
          &quot;security&quot; and &quot;dignity&quot; of Indian diplomats and
          missions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing diplomatic relations with China, Green advocated for
          dialogue and diplomacy as the preferred approach to maintain
          stability. While emphasizing the importance of preserving the
          &quot;status quo&quot; along the India-China border, he underscored
          the need to avoid unilateral changes. Green stressed the significance
          of engaging in dialogue with China to navigate bilateral issues within
          established rules and norms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responding to queries about the scheduled Quad meeting around Republic
          Day (January 26), the Australian High Commissioner deferred to the
          Indian Prime Minister&apos;s discretion, acknowledging India&apos;s
          chairmanship of the Quad this year. Green affirmed his Prime
          Minister&apos;s strong commitment to the Quad and expressed
          flexibility regarding the meeting&apos;s timing and location, leaving
          the decision entirely to the Indian Prime Minister, who holds the
          chairmanship.

        <p>
          Today marks the centenary of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji, a stalwart
          whose unwavering commitment to social justice left an indelible impact
          on millions of lives. Although I never had the opportunity to meet
          Karpoori Ji, I&apos;ve heard about him from Kailashpati Mishra Ji, who
          closely collaborated with him. Hailing from the Nai Samaj, one of the
          most backward sections of society, Karpoori Ji overcame numerous
          hurdles, achieving significant milestones for societal betterment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karpoori Thakur Ji&apos;s life was characterized by simplicity and a
          relentless pursuit of social justice. His modest lifestyle and humble
          demeanor resonated with the common people until his last breath.
          Anecdotes abound, illustrating his simplicity, like his preference to
          use personal funds for his daughter&apos;s wedding. During his tenure
          as Bihar&apos;s Chief Minister, a decision to build a colony for
          political leaders was made, yet he declined any allocation of land or
          money for himself. When he passed away in 1988, leaders visiting his
          village were moved to tears witnessing the simplicity of his home.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1977, shortly after assuming office as Bihar&apos;s CM, Karpoori Ji
          attended a Janata leaders&apos; gathering in Patna to commemorate
          Loknayak JP’s birthday. Despite his torn kurta, he declined assistance
          from Chandrashekhar Ji, opting to donate the contributed money to the
          CM Relief Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social justice was Karpoori Thakur Ji&apos;s paramount concern. His
          political journey reflected monumental efforts to create a society
          where resources were equitably distributed, offering opportunities to
          all, irrespective of social standing. He took an anti-Congress stance
          early on, convinced that the party had deviated from its founding
          principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initiating his electoral career in the early 1950s, Karpoori Ji became
          a formidable voice for the working class, laborers, small farmers, and
          youth. Education was a cause close to his heart, driving initiatives
          to improve educational facilities for the underprivileged. As Chief
          Minister, he implemented measures for senior citizens&apos; welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Democracy, debate, and discussion were integral to Karpoori Ji’s
          personality, evident in his involvement in the Quit India movement and
          resistance against the Emergency. His unique perspectives garnered
          admiration from leaders like JP, Dr Lohia, and Charan Singh Ji.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karpoori Thakur Ji&apos;s significant contribution to India included
          strengthening affirmative action for backward classes, challenging
          opposition to provide deserved representation and opportunities.
          Despite facing heavy resistance, he stood firm, implementing policies
          that laid the foundation for a more inclusive society. His lack of
          bitterness despite belonging to the most backward strata showcased
          true greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last decade, our government has followed in Karpoori Ji’s
          path, reflecting transformative empowerment in our schemes and
          policies. While social justice remained a mere political slogan for
          many, inspired by Karpoori Ji&apos;s vision, we implemented it as an
          effective governance model. Achievements, including uplifting 25 crore
          people from poverty and ensuring 100% coverage in various schemes,
          align with his commitment to social welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
          The economic independence achieved through MUDRA Loans for
          entrepreneurs from OBC, SC, and ST communities fulfills Karpoori
          Thakur Ji’s vision. Our government extended reservations for SC, ST,
          and OBC, establishing the OBC Commission to work in line with Karpoori
          Ji&apos;s ideals. The PM-Vishwakarma Scheme promises prosperity for
          OBC communities across India.
        </p>
        <p>
          As someone from the backward classes, I owe much to Jan Nayak Karpoori
          Thakur Ji. Although he left us at the young age of 64, his legacy
          lives on in the hearts and minds of millions. He was truly a Jan
          Nayak!

          Addressing the Nigeria-India Business Council (NIBC), External Affairs
          Minister S Jaishankar emphasized India&apos;s commitment to fostering
          ties with Nigeria, aiming to elevate the partnership to a &quot;higher
          level.&quot; Jaishankar, who recently attended the Non-Aligned
          Movement (NAM) Summit in Uganda, highlighted the evolving global order
          and the crucial role of Africa&apos;s economic rise in reshaping it.

          Jaishankar asserted that the rebalancing and reordering of the global
          order hinge on Africa&apos;s economic ascent. He stressed that for
          Africa to play its due role, it must not merely serve as a market or
          resource provider but actively participate in the global economic
          landscape. India, he affirmed, is placing its bets on Africa&apos;s
          rise, considering the continent&apos;s demographic potential, abundant
          resources, ambitious aspirations, and evolving policy alignments.

          The minister acknowledged the shared history and solidarity between
          India and Africa, underscoring the importance of Africa taking its
          rightful place in the changing global order for true multipolarity. He
          identified digital public infrastructure, green and clean growth,
          water, agricultural sustainability, security, and the blue economy as
          key areas for collaboration between India and Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jaishankar outlined the existing trade ties between India and Nigeria,
          with an annual trade value of USD 13 to 15 billion and India
          committing nearly USD 30 billion in investments. He urged stakeholders
          not to be complacent, emphasizing the untapped potential for increased
          trade between the two nations. Nigeria, he emphasized, holds a premier
          position as India&apos;s economic partner in Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Nigeria-India Joint Commission (NIJC) meeting, Jaishankar
          discussed the expansion of economic cooperation, highlighting
          opportunities in energy, power, renewables, transport, healthcare,
          fintech, agriculture, and security. The minister acknowledged the
          challenges faced by Nigerian students in visa renewals, and consular
          matters were addressed, seeking resolutions through diplomatic
          channels.
        </p>

          In Lagos, Jaishankar spoke at the Nigerian Institute Of International
          Affairs (NIIA), emphasizing the importance of the Global South&apos;s
          advancement for planetary progress. He characterized the Global South
          as a mindset, solidarity, and self-reliance, emphasizing its role in
          promoting rebalancing and multipolarity on the global stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concluding his visit to Nigeria, Jaishankar expressed gratitude for
          the hospitality and affirmed his commitment to elevating India-Nigeria
          ties. He recognized the significant role of trade and investment in
          the partnership and commended those driving it forward.
