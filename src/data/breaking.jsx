          After forty years, the greater one-horned rhinoceros has made a
          comeback to the Laokhowa-Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary in central
          Assam, according to officials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up until 1983, there were at least 45 rhinos living in the 309.2 sq.
          km. wildlife sanctuary (WLS) in the Nagaon district, which is a part
          of the Greater Kaziranga landscape. Although stray rhinos from Orang
          National Park across the Brahmaputra River and the Kaziranga National
          Park to the east were known to briefly enter the WLS, widespread
          encroachment and poaching ultimately led to their extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the return of our famous rhinos to Laokhowa
          and Burachapori, after a 40-year absence, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa
          Sarma posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Friday night. Stating that
          they had returned within a year of our successful anti-encroachment
          operation in the area. He also mentioned that following the eviction
          drive in 2023, 51.7 square kilometers of forest cover had been
          recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to wildlife officials, the two rhinos are thought to have
          entered through Arimari, where between February 13 and 15, 2023,
          encroachers were removed from 1,282 hectares of forest land and 817
          hectares of unsurveyed government land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since November 2023, rhinos have been seen in Laokhowa-Burachapori, a
          great place for freshwater mangroves to live. The WLS also has ten
          tigers on file, suggesting a healthy base of herbivorous prey for
          these animals, according to Kaziranga&apos;s field director, Sonali
          Ghosh.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent filling of 75 frontline positions and the recruitment of
          new personnel have been credited with increasing sanctuary protection.

          In light of the growing diplomatic ties between the two countries,
          China stated on Monday that it is willing to carry out trilateral
          cooperation between India and the Maldives. China&apos;s announcement
          coincides with President Mohamed Muizzu of the Maldives&apos; visit to
          the nation.

        <p>
          Editorial in China&apos;s official media — Global Times — discusses
          the growing diplomatic spat between India and the Maldives in the wake
          of insulting remarks made by Maldivian ministers against Prime
          Minister Narendra Modi.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It also respects the friendly and cooperative relationship
          between the Maldives and India, fully aware of the importance for Male
          to maintain good relations with New Delhi,&quot; reads the editorial
          in China&apos;s Global Times. Beijing does not see cooperation between
          the Maldives and India as hostile or dangerous, and it has never asked
          Male to reject New Delhi due to disputes between China and India,
          according to an editorial in the Global Times.
        </p>
        <p>
          It went on to say: &quot;China is also open to implementing trilateral
          cooperation with the Maldives, India, and China. Since China does not
          view its cooperation with South Asian nations as a zero-sum endeavor,
          New Delhi should continue to be more accommodating.&quot;

              On Monday, Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu landed in China.
            </li>
            <li>
              Muizzu is currently on a five-day visit to China with Sajidha
              Mohamed, the nation&apos;s first lady.
            </li>
            <li>
              Muizzu is seen as pro-Chinese, and since taking office, he has
              been strengthening relations with the nation led by Xi Jinping.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Maldives and India have long had close relations. India was a
              close collaborator of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, Muizzu&apos;s
              predecessor.
            </li>

              The Maldivian government announced on social media the
              Muizzu&apos;s arrival in China.

          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Maldives President&apos;s Office stated that H.E. Xi Jinping, the
          president of China, has invited this visit. When Muizzu arrived at the
          airport in Fujian, he was observed being welcomed by Chinese
          officials. President Xi Jinping of China has invited Muizzu and his
          spouse on a state visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Muizzu of the Maldives is on his first bilateral visit since
          taking office on December 17 of last year. Rumor has it that during
          Muizzu&apos;s visit, China and the Maldives will have formal
          discussions and sign important agreements to improve trade,
          professional growth, and socioeconomic cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Muizzu will also meet important Chinese business executives at the
          Invest Maldives Forum in Fuzhou. The President&apos;s Office of the
          Maldives released a statement saying, &quot;The visit aims to pave the
          way for technological and other collaborations between the two
          countries.&quot; The President and First Lady of the Maldives are
          accompanied by a high-level delegation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maldives President&apos;s Office stated, &quot;Additionally, the
          President will meet with senior Chinese government officials, attend
          the Invest Maldives Forum, and have meetings with senior Chinese
          business leaders to explore avenues of mutual collaborations in
          investments and trade between the Maldives and China.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          On October 14, 1972, China and the Maldives established diplomatic
          relations. Since that time, China and the Maldives have made a
          concerted effort to strengthen their friendship.

          In response, Altman said, &quot;I&apos;m Jewish. I see a lot of people

          Human rights activists point out that since October 7, when the
          Palestinian Islamist organization Hamas attacked Israel and killed
          1,200 people, according to Israeli estimates, antisemitism and

          The Council on American-Islamic Relations reported last month that,

          increase in incidents in the United States motivated by Islamophobia
          and bias against Palestinians and Arabs in the two months following
          the start of the war.
