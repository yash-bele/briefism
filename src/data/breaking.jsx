          In a tragic example of a failed romantic relationship, a man in Mumbai
          killed his partner. Three months ago, the pair connected on social
          media. The incident happened in Navi Mumbai&apos;s Turbhe. The crime
          blurred the lines between revenge and love when a 24-year-old man
          named Shoaib Sheikh planned the 35-year-old bank manager Amit Kaur—a
          divorcee and mother of a teenage girl was killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story started a few months ago, when Shoaib and Amit connected on
          social media. When Shoaib arrived in Turbhe on January 8th to
          celebrate Kaur&apos;s birthday, what appeared to be a blossoming
          romance took a dark turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the details given by the police, it appears that Shoaib
          killed Amit Kaur by strangulation in a lodge where they were
          celebrating, driven by feelings of suspicion and grief. Shoaib left
          the scene after carrying out the horrific deed, leaving the staff to
          discover the woman&apos;s lifeless body when they opened the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shoaib Sheikh was taken into custody by the Sakinaka police in Mumbai
          after they carried out an investigation. After being arrested, the
          young man—who worked in a garage—finally admitted to the crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the police, Shoaib&apos;s misgivings about his lover
          ultimately motivated him to commit the murder. The victim, a
          well-liked bank manager, had no idea what evil plans had been
          simmering inside of Shoaib.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic event clarified the effects of a relationship poisoned by
          suspicion and deceit. The community was left reeling from the shocking
          reality that had descended upon them as the legal proceedings
          progressed and the dark secrets underlying this bizarre story of love
          and betrayal continued to come to light.

          When the vegetarian food offered to a woman traveling from Calicut to
          Mumbai on an Air India flight discovered pieces of chicken in it, she
          was taken aback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, Veera Jain shared the entire tale on X, a platform that was
          formerly Twitter. She also posted pictures of the food served to her
          by the airline.

          “On my @airindia flight AI582, I was served a veg meal with chicken
          pieces in it! I boarded the flight from Calicut airport. This was a
          flight that was supposed to take off at 18:40PM but left the airport
          at 19:40PM,” Veera Jain wrote.

          The word &quot;Veg&quot; is clearly visible on the wrapper of her food
          packet in the pictures she posted, but the chicken pieces inside are
          also irresistible. The woman continued to tweet &quot;When I told the
          cabin supervisor (Sona), she apologized and told me that there were
          other complaints about the same issue besides mine and my
          friend&apos;s. But nothing was done to let other passengers know that
          other people were eating vegetarian meals after I told the crew.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          She went on to say that she felt hurt and that she no longer trusted
          Air India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veera also appeared to be having trouble with the flight&apos;s
          takeoff delay. According to her, the AI582 flight was scheduled to
          depart at 6:40 p.m., but it was delayed by one hour. Her friend missed
          her train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad at 11 p.m. that night because of
          the delayed flight. At 8:40 p.m., the AI582 was supposed to touch down
          in Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Air India has not yet responded to this incident, so Jain urged the
          Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Indian Civil Aviation Authority
          (DGCA), and Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia to look into
          the situation.
