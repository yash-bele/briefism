        <p>
          In the latest episode of the diplomatic dispute between India and
          Maldives, the island nation&apos;s two primary Opposition parties, the
          Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and the Democrats, have expressed
          serious reservations regarding President Mohamed Muizzu&apos;s
          perceived &apos;anti-India&apos; stance. These parties, labeling India
          as their &quot;most long-standing ally,&quot; voiced their support for
          India just one day after the Maldivian government granted permission
          for a Chinese research and survey ship to dock at a Maldivian port for
          replenishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Mohamed Muizzu, known for his pro-China inclinations, chose
          to visit China instead of following the tradition of an initial visit
          to India after assuming office. This departure from established norms
          added fuel to the controversy sparked by &apos;derogatory&apos;
          remarks made by three Maldivian ministers about Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi and his visit to Lakshadweep.
        </p>
        <p>
          In their joint assessment of the Maldivian government&apos;s foreign
          policy direction, the MDP and the Democrats expressed concern over
          what they perceive as a significant shift towards an
          &apos;anti-India&apos; position. They emphasized the potential harm of
          alienating a crucial development partner, particularly one with a
          longstanding alliance. The Opposition parties highlighted the
          importance of maintaining stable and secure conditions in the Indian
          Ocean for the overall stability and security of the Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a joint news conference, MDP&apos;s chairperson and former
          Minister Fayyaz Ismail, Deputy Speaker of the Parliament MP Ahmed
          Saleem, along with Democrats party president MP Hassan Latheef and
          Parliamentary Group Leader MP Ali Azim, shared their apprehensions
          about the current administration&apos;s foreign policy. They
          underscored the need for consecutive governments to collaborate with
          all development partners, as has been the traditional approach in the
          Maldives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Opposition parties, which collectively hold 55 seats in the
          87-member house, pledged to collaborate on various governance-related
          issues while expressing broader concerns, including the lack of
          transparency in the state&apos;s financial status and the undisclosed
          details of Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Agreements signed by
          the government with foreign entities. Although the joint statement did
          not specify countries, it indicated unease about the undisclosed
          engagements with foreign parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the Opposition criticized the Mohamed Muizzu
          government&apos;s actions aimed at censoring the media and impinging
          on press freedom. These concerns, encompassing transparency issues,
          foreign policy direction, and media freedom, were conveyed through a
          joint press conference and disseminated on the official websites and
          social media handles of both Maldivian Opposition parties.

          Canada&apos;s ongoing public inquiry into foreign interference is set
          to examine allegations of India&apos;s involvement in recent national
          elections, potentially heightening tensions between the two nations,
          as reported by Bloomberg.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inquiry, initiated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in response to
          leaked intelligence documents suggesting Chinese interference in
          Canada&apos;s elections, is scheduled to commence public hearings next
          week. The inquiry commissioner is tasked with investigating potential
          interference in Canada&apos;s 2019 and 2021 elections by China,
          Russia, and various state and non-state entities. While specific
          countries are not explicitly named, national security officials have
          hinted at India and Iran being significant sources of potential
          foreign meddling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The commission confirmed on Wednesday that the government of Prime
          Minister Narendra Modi will be subject to investigation. The inquiry
          has requested information and documents related to alleged election
          interference without specifying the nature of the allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September, Trudeau made headlines by asserting that India was
          behind the murder of a Sikh activist on Canadian soil. The victim,
          Hardeep Singh Nijjar, was labeled a terrorist by India due to his
          advocacy for an independent Sikh nation called Khalistan. This
          allegation strained Canada-India relations, leading to a forceful
          denial by Modi&apos;s administration, temporary visa suspensions for
          Canadians, and threats to revoke the immunity of Canadian diplomats in
          India. Trade talks between the countries have been stalled for months.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November, the credibility of Canada&apos;s claim seemed to gain
          support when US federal prosecutors accused an Indian government agent
          of directing a thwarted plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York.
          India took a more cooperative stance with the US, forming a committee
          to investigate the allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The foreign interference inquiry is expected to strain Canada&apos;s
          relationships with both India and China. Trudeau and Chinese President
          Xi Jinping expelled one diplomat each in a reciprocal response to last
          year&apos;s interference allegations. China has urged Canada to
          &quot;stop hyping up China-related lies and false information.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial hearings of the inquiry will focus on the challenges of
          disclosing classified national security intelligence to the public.
          Notable speakers, including David Vigneault, the director of the
          Canadian Security Intelligence Agency, and Dominic LeBlanc,
          Canada&apos;s Public Safety Minister, are scheduled to address this
          aspect of the investigation.

        <p>
          US aviation regulators have instructed Boeing to halt any further
          increases in production rates for its 737 Max aircraft. This decision
          comes alongside the approval of inspection procedures necessary for
          the 737 Max&apos;s return to service after being grounded by the
          Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) earlier this month. The
          FAA&apos;s action restricts Boeing from augmenting the output of its
          lucrative jetliners in the near term, a critical development as
          airlines are eager for new aircraft to meet the surging demand for air
          travel. The decision comes just before Boeing&apos;s CEO, Dave
          Calhoun, is set to announce annual targets for 737 deliveries on
          January 31.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boeing had been working to stabilize 737 production at 38 jets per
          month before an incident involving an Alaska Airlines Max 9, where a
          door plug detached mid-flight, prompted a temporary halt. While the
          company had indicated plans to accelerate production in the first
          quarter, the FAA&apos;s recent decision puts a damper on these
          efforts. Additionally, the FAA is suspending work on Boeing&apos;s
          intended new 737 final assembly line at its widebody plant in Everett.
        </p>
        <p>
          FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker emphasized that Boeing would not be
          granted any expansion in production until the identified quality
          control issues were satisfactorily addressed. This decision adds to
          the challenges Boeing faces following the Alaska Airlines incident,
          which triggered intense scrutiny from regulators, customers, and the
          public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boeing&apos;s aim to return 737 production to pre-COVID levels by
          mid-decade, critical for managing its debt, is now hampered by the
          FAA&apos;s restrictions. The company had been installing a fourth
          final assembly line in its Everett factory to accommodate higher
          production rates. This line, situated outside the traditional
          narrowbody manufacturing hub in Renton, was expected to play a key
          role in increasing output.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the FAA&apos;s decision, Boeing&apos;s shares
          experienced a decline of up to 4.5% in after-hours trading. Meanwhile,
          operators of the Max 9, such as United Airlines Holdings Inc. and
          Alaska Air Group Inc., are allowed to resume flights after
          inspections. Alaska Airlines plans to return its first Max 9 to
          service on January 26, with inspections on its full fleet completed by
          February 2. United is set to resume Max 9 flights starting January 28.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FAA&apos;s confidence in proceeding with inspections and
          maintenance is based on an exhaustive review conducted over several
          weeks, according to Whitaker. The FAA&apos;s decision marks a
          significant development in Boeing&apos;s efforts to navigate the
          aftermath of the Max 9 incident and restore confidence in the safety
          of its aircraft.

          North Korea announced the successful testing of its new strategic
          cruise missile, as reported by state media KCNA on Thursday, thereby
          corroborating the South Korean military&apos;s statement from the
          previous day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The missile, named &quot;Pulhwasal-3-31,&quot; is presently in the
          developmental phase, and the test launch did not pose any security
          threat to neighboring countries, according to state media. The report
          emphasized that the test was unrelated to the regional situation and
          was part of the ongoing process to enhance the country&apos;s weapon
          system, as mentioned by The Missile Administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Wednesday, South Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff disclosed that
          North Korea had launched multiple cruise missiles towards the sea off
          its west coast at approximately 7 a.m. (2200 GMT on Tuesday). In
          response, Seoul&apos;s defense minister, Shin Won-sik, condemned the
          launches, characterizing them as a significant threat to South Korea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term &quot;strategic&quot; in this context typically implies the
          potential for nuclear capabilities in the weapons being referred to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This event marks North Korea&apos;s second test of a cruise missile
          with potential nuclear strike capabilities, following the first test
          conducted in September 2021. Cruise missiles, while not explicitly
          prohibited by any U.N. Security Council resolutions, have garnered
          less international attention than ballistic missiles. However,
          analysts argue that intermediate-range, land-attack cruise missiles
          possess a threat comparable to ballistic missiles and represent a
          significant capability for North Korea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ambiguity surrounding the warhead of cruise missiles and
          short-range ballistic missiles, which can be armed with either
          conventional or nuclear payloads, is viewed as a destabilizing factor
          in the event of a conflict. The uncertainty about the nature of the
          warhead increases the potential for miscalculation and escalation
          during hostilities.

          India&apos;s ongoing free trade negotiations with the UK and the
          European Union (EU) may potentially exclude discussions on the
          contentious carbon tax issue in a bid to expedite the trade
          agreements, according to three individuals familiar with the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lack of consensus on the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)
          raises concerns for Indian steel exports to the region, as it could
          increase export costs and diminish profits. India is actively engaged
          in separate free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with both the UK
          and the EU.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the anonymous sources mentioned a sense of urgency in
          finalizing these FTAs due to the impending conclusion of the
          government&apos;s term. Talks on the CBAM would be conducted
          independently by the steel and external affairs ministries with their
          foreign counterparts.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of now, the ministries of commerce and steel have not responded to
          queries on this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EU&apos;s CBAM, along with a parallel policy in the UK, aims to
          impose a carbon tax on imports of iron and steel, aluminum, cement,
          ceramics, fertilizer, glass, and hydrogen into the region starting
          January 2026. The purpose of the levy, as stated by the UK and EU, is
          to establish a fair price for carbon emitted during the production of
          these goods outside the region and protect local producers from price
          disadvantages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian steelmakers have been actively advocating for concessions on
          CBAM as part of the ongoing FTA discussions. However, with the
          exclusion of this topic from the discussions, it introduces
          uncertainty for Indian steel exporters. Queries directed to the Indian
          Steel Association, the primary lobby for the domestic steel industry,
          have not been answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          An industry executive suggested that the exclusion of CBAM from FTA
          negotiations might be a strategic move by India. The executive noted
          concerns about the lack of transparency in the EU or the UK&apos;s
          emission calculation mechanism and likened integrating CBAM into the
          FTAs at this stage to surrendering a valuable tool without gaining
          clarity on the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to an analysis by Icra Ltd., CBAM compliance requirements
          could lead to a reduction in profits for Indian steel exports to the
          EU by $60-165/tonne between 2026 and 2034. A similar impact is
          anticipated for exports to the UK. Indian steelmakers view CBAM as a
          trade barrier, emphasizing the need for considerations of historical
          emissions of developed nations in these discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prabodha Acharya, Chief Sustainability Officer at JSW Group, a leading
          steel exporter, expressed concerns about CBAM&apos;s potential
          negative impact on trade balance and emphasized that it should not be
          a mandate in FTA negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exclusion of CBAM from discussions could significantly affect
          Indian steel exporters. In 2023, India exported about 3.6 million
          tonnes of finished steel to Europe and 0.4 million tonnes to the UK,
          accounting for nearly half of India&apos;s total steel exports,
          according to data from SteelMint.

        <p>
          Fox Corp. has been granted the opportunity to challenge Smartmatic
          Corp.&apos;s $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit, which Fox argues
          excessively inflates the financial harm it endured due to broadcasts
          falsely accusing it of manipulating the 2020 US election. New York
          Judge David B. Cohen rejected Smartmatic&apos;s request to dismiss
          Fox&apos;s counterclaims, ruling that Fox can assert Smartmatic is
          attempting to curb its free speech rights through the substantial
          lawsuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Justice Cohen is expected to soon make a decision on Fox&apos;s motion
          to dismiss Smartmatic&apos;s defamation suit outright. At present,
          both Smartmatic&apos;s lawsuit, accusing Fox of engaging in a
          &quot;disinformation campaign&quot; to promote Donald Trump&apos;s
          vote-rigging theory, and Fox&apos;s counterclaims will progress
          simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ruling follows Fox&apos;s agreement less than a year ago to pay
          $787.5 million to settle a $1.6 billion defamation suit brought by
          another voting machine firm, Dominion Voting Systems Inc., which
          leveled similar accusations. Former President Trump continues to
          falsely claim that the 2020 election was stolen as he campaigns for a
          return to the White House.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Tuesday&apos;s ruling, Cohen dismissed Smartmatic&apos;s argument
          that Fox&apos;s settlement with Dominion, combined with significant
          rulings against Fox in that case, justified the dismissal of
          Fox&apos;s counterclaims. Instead, the judge concluded that Fox&apos;s
          specific argument regarding exaggerated damages needs to be addressed
          in court.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ruling represents a significant setback for Smartmatic, which
          asserts that its reputation suffered severe damage when Fox News hosts
          and guests continued to amplify the election conspiracy theory despite
          widespread debunking. Guests, including Rudy Giuliani, falsely alleged
          that Smartmatic colluded with Dominion and foreign hackers to
          manipulate millions of votes away from Trump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smartmatic has not immediately responded to a request for comment on
          the ruling.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its counterclaims, Fox contends that Smartmatic&apos;s $2.7 billion
          demand is &quot;fanciful&quot; and accuses the voting machine company
          of inflating its financial harm by falsely claiming it &quot;stood to
          make nearly $2 billion in annual revenue in 2025.&quot; According to
          Fox, this figure is over four times Smartmatic&apos;s highest reported
          revenues within the past nine years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fox argues that these alleged exaggerations violate New York&apos;s
          anti-SLAPP law (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation),
          designed to prevent the filing of cases intended to stifle free
          speech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite facing legal challenges related to the 2020 election, Fox has
          maintained its denial of wrongdoing, asserting that its journalists
          were reporting objectively on claims made by a sitting president and
          his allies regarding the fraudulent nature of the election.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case is Smartmatic USA Corp. v. Fox Corp., 151136/2021, New York
          State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).
