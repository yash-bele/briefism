        Given that police and prosecutors are currently dealing with a massive
        backlog of real rape cases, the inquiry into the historic case has
        raised concerns about whether police should be pursuing virtual
        offenses.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first case of alleged rape in a virtual reality game is being looked
        into by UK police after a 16-year-old girl was &quot;sexually
        attacked&quot; in the online &quot;metaverse&quot;. According to The New
        York, the girl was left upset when strangers she met online gang-raped
        her avatar, or virtual character. According to the report, the teen was
        playing an immersive virtual reality game when she was allegedly raped
        by several men. Investigating officers claimed that despite her lack of
        physical harm, she experienced the same emotional and psychological
        trauma as someone who has been sexually assaulted in the &quot;real
        world.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        It is thought that this is the first virtual sexual offense that the
        police have looked into. &quot;Psychological trauma suffered by this
        child is comparable to that of a person who has been sexually assaulted.
        Longer-lasting than any physical wounds are the emotional and
        psychological effects on the victim, a senior officer with knowledge of
        the case told the news outlet. &quot;It poses a number of challenges for
        law enforcement given current legislation is not set up for this,&quot;
        said the officer.
        <br />
        <br />
        What game the teenage girl was playing at the time of the alleged
        offense is still unknown, though. Given that police and prosecutors are
        currently dealing with a massive backlog of real rape cases, the inquiry
        into the historic case has raised concerns about whether police should
        be pursuing virtual offenses.
        <br />
        <br />
        James Cleverly, the UK&apos;s home secretary, has defended the virtual
        reality rape investigation, claiming that the child has experienced
        &quot;sexual trauma&quot;. Mr. Cleverly told news outlet LBC, &quot;I
        know it is easy to dismiss this as being not real, but the whole point
        of these virtual environments is they are incredibly immersive.&quot;
        &quot;It&apos;s also worth realising that somebody who is willing to put
        a child through a trauma like that digitally may well be someone that
        could go on to do terrible things in the physical realm.&quot;

        The government has canceled the nationwide truckers&apos; strike,
        promising to consult all relevant parties before enacting a
        controversial anti-hit-and-run law. The All-India Motor Transport
        Congress decided to end the agitation after extensive negotiations with
        the government.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;We had a conversation with representatives of the All India Motor
        Transport Congress... the administration wishes to clarify that the new
        regulation has not yet been put into effect. Union Home Secretary Ajay
        Bhalla stated this evening, &quot;We all want to say that before
        implementing Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita 106/2, we will have a discussion
        with representatives of the All India Motor Transport Congress and only
        then will we take a decision.&quot; The new legislation isn&apos;t yet
        in effect. The All India Transport Congress will only be consulted
        before it is implemented, as confirmed by Bal Malkit, the head of the
        AIMTC&apos;s core committee.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Indian Penal Code from the colonial era was to be replaced by the
        Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita, or BNS, which has strict penalties for
        hit-and-run incidents. This is why there was protest over Section 106(2)
        of the BNS. There was fear of an all-India truckers strike due to a
        shortage of fuel and other necessities. Many states, including Jammu and
        Kashmir, Bihar, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh,
        and Chhattisgarh, had witnessed the protests.
        <br />
        <br />
        The previous penalty for hit-and-run incidents was up to two years in
        jail and a lesser fine; under the new law, the maximum sentence is ten
        years in jail and a fine of â‚¹ 7 lakh. When someone causes death by
        reckless driving and leaves the scene without calling the police, they
        will be sentenced to a maximum of ten years in prison.
        <br />
        <br />
        Drivers of commercial vehicles, such as cabbies and truckers, are
        wondering how they would afford to pay such a high fine in the event of
        an accident. The potential for legal abuse, the procedure for alerting
        authorities due to the possibility of public outrage, and the type of
        evidence that will be accepted in the event of a dispute are all
        concerns raised by experts.

        Japanese investigators on Wednesday probed a near-catastrophic collision
        at Tokyo&apos;s Haneda Airport between a coast guard plane and a
        passenger jet that airline executives have said was given permission to
        land.
        <br />
        <br />
        Five people on the coast guard aircraft died, but all 379 passengers and
        crew escaped to safety down emergency slides minutes before the Japan
        Airlines Airbus was engulfed in flames late Tuesday. The burned-out husk
        of the airliner, still sitting on the tarmac Wednesday, bore witness to
        just how narrow their escape had been. The captain of the coast guard
        plane -- which had been carrying aid to the New Year&apos;s Day
        earthquake zone -- was its lone survivor but suffered serious injuries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Footage on Tuesday showed a ball of fire erupting and thick black smoke
        from underneath the airliner shortly after landing and coming to a halt
        on its nose after its front landing gear failed. Passengers could be
        seen sliding down inflatable slides as flames shot out from the rear of
        the aircraft in video posted to social media platform X. As the plane
        was evacuated, dozens of fire engines with blue and red flashing lights
        tried to douse the flames but the entire plane was soon engulfed and it
        took eight hours to finally extinguish the blaze.
        <br />
        <br />
        Landing clearance Government officials pledged to investigate how the
        incident happened in a country that had not seen a serious commercial
        aviation accident for decades. Asked at a briefing late Tuesday night
        whether the Japan Airlines flight had secured landing permission from
        air traffic control, officials at the major carrier said: &quot;Our
        understanding is that it was given.&quot; But JAL and the land ministry
        declined to comment directly on exchanges between flight controllers and
        the two planes, citing the ongoing investigation. In a recording from
        Haneda&apos;s control tower apparently taken in the moments before the
        collision, available on a site that broadcasts live air traffic signals,
        a voice can be heard advising JAL&apos;s flight to &quot;continue
        approach&quot;.
        <br />
        <br />
        Some domestic flights were operating on Wednesday morning from Haneda,
        one of the world&apos;s busiest airports, but dozens were cancelled.
        France&apos;s Airbus, which manufactured the JAL plane, said it would
        send a team of specialists to help Japanese authorities investigate. The
        passenger plane had arrived from New Chitose Airport serving Sapporo on
        the northern island of Hokkaido. Those on board included eight children.
        <br />
        <br />
        The coast guard plane had been preparing to fly to Ishikawa prefecture
        to deliver supplies after the devastating New Year&apos;s Day earthquake
        that killed at least 62 people. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida praised the
        dead crew members on their way to help the victims of the quake.

        A â‚¹ 799 registration fee was required of the interested men. The group
        gave them some pictures after they registered and asked them to select
        the woman they wanted to get pregnant.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Bihar, eight people have been taken into custody for allegedly paying
        men â‚¹ 13 lakh to get women who were infertile pregnant.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to the police, the ring was operated under the name &quot;All
        India Pregnant Job Service&quot;.
        <br />
        <br />
        The arrests took place in Nawada, Bihar. According to the police, the
        accused would reach out to men on social media and WhatsApp, offering
        them the chance to make thousands of rupees in exchange for their
        &quot;service&quot;. A â‚¹ 799 registration fee was required of the
        interested men. The group gave them some pictures after they registered
        and asked them to select the woman they wanted to get pregnant.
        Afterwards, a security deposit of â‚¹ 5 to â‚¹ 20,000 was requested of them,
        depending on how &quot;attractive the woman was.&quot;
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;The men were informed that should the woman become pregnant, they
        would receive â‚¹ 13 lakh. Superintendent of Police in Nawada Kalyan Anand
        stated, &quot;They were promised a consolation price of â‚¹ 5 lakh even if
        they failed to impregnate the woman.&quot; Following a raid in Nawada by
        a Bihar police Special Investigation Team (SIT), the arrests were made.
        Officials stated that police have located cell phones and a printer on
        the premises and that they are still looking for the other suspects,
        including the mastermind.

        precautionary measure.&quot;

        <br />
        Curfews were also reinstated in the districts of Thoubal, Imphal East,
        Kakching, and Bishnupur.

        Chief Minister N Biren Singh promised that &quot;the perpetrators would
        be found in a video statement, despite the lack of information
        surrounding the incident. We take this incident very seriously. The
        Manipur police are working hard to find the offenders. I beg everyone,

        According to officials cited by PTI, the as-yet-unidentified gunmen
        arrived disguised as locals and started shooting. Hospitalized are five
        more injured individuals. A few cars were set on fire by angry locals
        following the attack. Three Manipur Police commandos were hurt on
        Saturday night, a few days prior, when an RPG attack occurred at one of
        their posts in the border town of Moreh. According to officials,
        suspected militants are thought to be responsible for the attack.

        More than 180 people have been killed and several hundred injured since
        ethnic violence between the Meitei and Kuki-Zomi communities broke out
        in Manipur on May 3. Meiteis account for about 53 per cent of
        Manipur&apos;s population and live mostly in the Imphal Valley. Tribals
        â€” Nagas and Kukis â€” constitute little over 40 per cent and reside in the
        hill districts.
