          Last week, the Hyderabad police made a major bust by arresting Rakesh
          Jain and Mahaveer Jain for illegally manufacturing and selling
          counterfeit Mysore Sandal soaps. This fraudulent operation had been
          running for nearly a decade across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and the
          Hyderabad-Karnataka region, causing estimated losses of Rs 500-600
          crore to the Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL) - the
          legitimate producer of Mysore Sandal soap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tip-off came from an anonymous message received by Karnataka
          Industries Minister M B Patil, who also chairs the KSDL. Acting on
          this lead, KSDL staff in Secunderabad purchased over Rs 5 lakh worth
          of fake soaps for testing, proving they were counterfeit. However,
          details on the manufacturers remained scant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cunning plan was hatched - a large Rs 25 lakh order was placed for
          the fake soaps as a pretense for visiting the secret manufacturing
          facility. This enabled the perpetrators to finally be identified and
          arrested. Investigations suggest the counterfeit operation
          specifically targeted religious events and tourist destinations where
          buyers may be less discerning about product authenticity. With
          estimated annual turnover of Rs 60 crore, it was a highly lucrative
          business built on deceit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scam worked by offering retailers substantially higher commissions
          than the genuine product, creating strong financial incentives to
          peddle the fake soaps. A 75g bar of real Mysore Sandal soap earns
          retailers minimal margin, but the counterfeits were sold at less than
          half price, generating huge profits. Similarly, boxes of 3 x 450g
          genuine soaps provide Rs 10 margin, but the fakes offered Rs 50 - a
          five-fold increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lab tests by KSDL revealed the counterfeit soaps contained dangerous
          heavy metals that could cause cancer. Genuine boxes have holograms, so
          lack of this security feature is a clear visual indicator of fakes.
          The criminals had exploited relaxed scrutiny of brands at religious
          fairs and festivals to pass off the hazardous products.
        </p>
        <p>
          A political angle also emerged, with allegations that the Jain
          brothers had links to local BJP leaders Manikant Rathod and Vittal
          Nayak. Photographs showing the accused with UP CM Yogi Adityanath and
          Telangana BJP MLA Raja Singh were revealed by Minister Priyank Kharge
          at a press conference. However, the BJP leaders strongly denied any
          connection to the crimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, a KSDL corruption scandal surfaced last year when
          former BJP MLA and KSDL chairman Madal Virupakshappa&apos;s son
          Prashanth was caught collecting bribes for supply contracts. A raid on
          his premises uncovered a massive Rs 8.20 crore of unaccounted cash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recent arrests prove more work is required to tackle the
          counterfeit trade which allows unscrupulous businesses to profit
          through deception and potentially harm public health. Tougher
          penalties and consumer education may help, but eliminating corrupt
          political connections will be key to effectively shutting down these
          dangerous fake networks for good.

          Police in Kerala arrested a 59-year-old Pentecostal pastor on Friday
          for the alleged sexual assault of a 13-year-old boy. The incident
          occurred this past Wednesday in a district in the southern region of
          the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to authorities, the pastor allegedly lured the vulnerable
          minor into a trap and sexually abused him. The young boy had been
          abandoned by his mother and was waiting for his grandmother, who had
          gone to the hospital, when the pastor approached him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identified as Raveendranath, the pastor invited the boy to his home
          after gaining his trust. At the residence, the pastor allegedly served
          the child cake before showing him pornographic images on a tablet
          device. Raveendranath then sexually assaulted the boy, as per the
          police complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accused has been booked under the Protection of Children from
          Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act based on the child&apos;s testimony. This
          law aims to deter and punish sexual crimes against minors.
        </p>
        <p>
          After being arrested, Raveendranath was produced before a magistrate
          who ordered he be placed in judicial custody pending trial. As the
          allegations involve abuse of a child who had been abandoned, the
          police will be investigating whether the pastor identified and
          targeted the vulnerable boy in a predatory manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faith leaders wielding influence over followers and having
          unsupervised access to minors must uphold the highest moral and
          ethical standards. This duty becomes even more onerous when engaging
          with children who lack parental care or support networks. Violating
          this trust can leave deep emotional and psychological scars, as
          evidenced by numerous cases of clergy abuse worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authorities have stated that the mental health and safety of the
          survivor are the primary concerns during trial, and counselling will
          be provided if required. The community must also reflect on how to
          prevent such exploitation of society&apos;s most vulnerable members.

          A shocking case of road rage occurred in Delhi&apos;s Janakpuri area
          on Wednesday morning, where a 22-year-old man was shot and injured by
          two men after his car accidentally brushed against their motorcycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to police reports, the victim, Jatin Jain, was with a female
          friend when the incident took place. While parking his car near a
          district center, it slightly collided with a motorcycle belonging to
          the two accused men. An intense argument broke out between Jain and
          the men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, when Jain and his friend crossed the road on her scooter, the
          accused allegedly followed them and demanded they stop. Another heated
          exchange occurred, after which one of the men pulled out a pistol and
          fired at Jain, with the bullet striking his left hip. Jain&apos;s
          friend fortunately escaped unharmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the accused, identified as Vishal Rai, was arrested at the
          scene by a nearby police patrol that rushed over after hearing the
          gunshot. However, Rai&apos;s associate managed to flee initially and
          was absconding.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Vichitra Veer,
          locals also hurried to help the injured Jain as his friend screamed
          for assistance, providing cover from the hostile men. Police recovered
          the pistol used in the attack from the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officials revealed Rai has a criminal background with over eight prior
          cases related to arms and ammunition, theft, and robbery charges. The
          injured Jain was transported to a hospital for treatment, while police
          registered a case of attempted murder.

          convicts are seeking an extension of time to surrender to authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bench headed by Justice BV Nagarathna, before whom the pleas were
          mentioned, directed the registry to get orders from the Chief Justice
          of India DY Chandrachud for reconstituting the original bench that
          heard the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The original case was decided by Justices Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan.
          However, Justice Nagarathna was sitting with Justice Sanjay Karol on
          Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
          On January 8, the Supreme Court had quashed the remission granted to
          the 11 convicts by the Gujarat government. The court had ordered them
          to surrender to jail authorities within two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the January 21 deadline approaching, three convicts have now
          moved the Supreme Court seeking more time to surrender, citing
          personal reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Thursday, their counsel urged the court to list the matter on
          Friday, January 19 given the looming deadline. The counsel added that
          though only three pleas have been filed currently, more may be
          submitted during the day.
        </p>

          CJI to reconstitute the original bench that heard the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The court said the listing is required urgently since the surrender
          deadline expires on January 21, 2024.

          A 37-year-old woman is in trouble with the Delhi Police for allegedly
          deceiving a five-star hotel in Aerocity by staying in a suite for two
          weeks, faking UPI payments amounting to Rs 5-7 lakh, and attempting to
          leave without settling her bills. The incident occurred at Pullman
          Hotel, and the accused, hailing from Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, is
          now under police scrutiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman arrived in Delhi alone on December 30 to celebrate New
          Year&apos;s Eve and checked into the hotel. During her stay until
          January 13, she reportedly utilized the spa and other amenities,
          incurring an additional cost of Rs 2.11 lakh. To avoid being linked to
          the charges, she allegedly used a fake name when availing these
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FIR, filed on January 13 based on the complaint of a Pullman Hotel
          staff member, reveals that the woman was evasive during police
          questioning. Initially claiming to be a lawyer, suspicions arose about
          her actual occupation, with an officer suggesting she may run a gift
          shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman purportedly attempted to feign payment for the services
          using fake UPI receipts. She showcased transactions on a bank&apos;s
          UPI mobile application, but upon verification, it was revealed that
          the bank had not received any payment. The investigation also
          disclosed that she had utilized the hotel&apos;s spa and fitness
          center under a false identity, accumulating services worth Rs 2.11
          lakh. The FIR alleges that when confronted about the fraudulent bank
          transactions, she hesitated to present the actual bank statement and
          later tried to escape with her bags from the hotel lobby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon being stopped by the hotel&apos;s security staff, she reportedly
          engaged in aggressive behavior, including scratching and abusing the
          staff. The police were called, and she was taken to the IGI Airport
          police station, where she was questioned and a case of cheating was
          registered against her.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the accused has been granted bail due to the bailable nature of
          the charges, the police are now collaborating with Andhra Pradesh
          authorities to gather information about her job, profile, and any
          potential criminal history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel staff was reportedly deceived for over two weeks as the
          woman presented different UPI and bank transaction receipts, and it
          took some time for the staff to scrutinize the bills and confront her.
          The Indian Express reached out to the Pullman Hotel front desk and the
          complainant for their response, which is awaited.

        <p>
          In December 2022, when Karnataka&apos;s Chief Minister hinted at
          lifting the ban on hijabs in educational institutions, Muskan Khan, a
          Muslim student who had discontinued her studies due to the ban,
          expressed her eagerness to resume her education. Khan had made
          headlines earlier in 2022 for defiantly wearing the hijab despite
          attempts by some Hindu boys to coerce her into removing it. After the
          statewide ban, she dropped out rather than remove her headscarf.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the ban was unjustified given it did not serve any legitimate
          public interest, Khan&apos;s stance raises a bigger question - why do
          young Muslims like her prioritize religious symbols over education,
          even giving up the latter?
        </p>
        <p>
          Reportedly, Khan has worn the hijab since childhood, perhaps from ages
          seven or eight. At that tender age, she could not have made an
          informed choice about religious identity markers. Her parents likely
          decided the hijab for her, normalizing it over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          This suggests that even if courts uphold the hijab as an exercise of
          the students&apos; right to free expression or conscience, their true
          autonomy can be questioned. The political theorist Isaiah Berlin
          differentiated between &quot;negative liberty&quot; - freedom from
          external constraints, and &quot;positive liberty&quot; - the autonomy
          to make uncoerced choices. So while courts may validate the
          students&apos; positive liberty, their negative liberty is debatable
          since coercion can take subtle forms beyond threats, like
          indoctrination. As Robert Sapolsky&apos;s recent book shows, free will
          can be distorted through various societal influences.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, many conservative Islamic schools in South India mandate
          the hijab as part of the uniform from primary to secondary levels.
          Moreover, many orthodox Muslim families make even young girls wear it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Problematic representations also exist, like images comparing hijabi
          and non-hijabi women to wrapped and unwrapped candies, insinuating
          only the &quot;wrapped&quot; women are protected from
          &quot;flies&quot;, i.e. harassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This indicates that the conditioning of Muslim girls into the hijab
          does occur. It raises doubts about the autonomy of students insisting
          on it inside or outside class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Significantly, the Quran does not prescribe any particular attire for
          women except modest clothing. It instructs women to &quot;lower their
          gaze&quot; - an instruction futile if in a full body veil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the word &quot;hijab&quot; occurs eight times in the Quran,
          but never denotes a headscarf. It refers to a metaphorical divide
          between people or things.
        </p>
        <p>
          In India, the hijab gained prominence mainly through the Indian
          Islamic scholar Abul Ala Maududi. His book &quot;Purdah and the Status
          of Women in Islam&quot; is widely cited by Muslim conservatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maududi insisted Muslim women cannot wear &quot;alluring&quot; clothes
          or display their beauty, but belong inside the household doing
          domestic duties. He blamed democracy and liberty for dissent against
          these views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Written in 1939, Maududi&apos;s shocking misconceptions have been
          circulating for over eighty years, spawning a paradox where free
          Muslim women use their liberty to impose patriarchal symbols in the
          name of a religion not mandating it.

          In conclusion, while the hijab ban was discriminatory, the bigger
          issue is the insidious conditioning of girls into prioritizing
          patriarchy-sanctioned attire over education in the name of religion.
          Their autonomy is constrained by decades of misleading propaganda
          about what Islamic principles actually entail. Upholding freedom of
          religion must be accompanied by reforms to ensure genuine informed
          consent.

          A local leader of the Rajput group Karni Sena was shot dead in Uttar
          Pradesh&apos;s Badaun district late Monday night. The killing occurred
          when three brothers allegedly broke into the leader&apos;s home
          intending to abduct his 17-year-old daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Badaun police, the key perpetrator Somendra Singh, known
          as Nanhe, aged 32, was arrested Tuesday morning. A manhunt is underway
          for his two absconding brothers, Antu and Satendra, who live near the
          victim&apos;s house in Sadaullah Ganj village.
        </p>
        <p>
          The deceased, Sudhir Kumar Singh, 40, was the Badaun district vice
          president of the Karni Sena, a conservative Rajput group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sudhir&apos;s elder brother Rajiv Singh, a farmer, filed a police
          complaint stating the brothers infiltrated the house around 11pm while
          family members were in different rooms. Nanhe entered by scaling the
          wall and opened the main door to let in his brothers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They tried to forcefully take away Sudhir&apos;s daughter but her
          mother raised an alarm. Sudhir came to intervene and was overpowered
          and shot in the right thigh. Hearing gunfire, neighbors rushed over
          but the perpetrators had fled. Sudhir was taken to the district
          hospital but succumbed to excessive bleeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police said the accused and victim had a political rivalry. The
          accused had previously tried unsuccessfully to abduct Sudhir&apos;s
          daughter four months ago to settle scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key accused Nanhe has been jailed while efforts are ongoing to nab
          his absconding brothers. As a precaution, adequate police presence has
          been deployed in the village.
        </p>
        <p>
          The killing illustrates the law and order challenges persisting in
          parts of Uttar Pradesh. Political or personal rivalries often manifest
          in crimes like murder, abuse of women, kidnapping, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          While police claim crimes have reduced under the current government,
          opposition parties contest this. They argue high-profile crimes
          continue unabated while victims from marginalized communities fail to
          get justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Badaun murder has shades of a recent case in Lakhimpur Kheri where
          a Union Minister&apos;s son allegedly mowed down farmers protesting
          against the ruling party. Together, these incidents highlight
          lingering concerns over VIP criminality and immunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, police have acted swiftly in the Karni Sena leader&apos;s
          murder, already arresting one culprit. This sends the right signal
          that political affiliations or influence will not deter
          investigations. Extending this accountability to all cases can
          significantly improve law and order and public trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond policing, addressing the root causes behind crimes of passion
          and honor killings remains critical. Illiteracy, lack of economic
          opportunities, patriarchal mindsets, easy access to guns are all
          contributing factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state government should pursue meaningful reforms on these social
          determinants by partnering with community leaders. Eradicating VIP
          culture around crimes is one piece of restoring law and order. But
          creating an enabling social environment for vulnerable groups like
          women and lower castes is equally important. A multi-pronged strategy
          only can make Uttar Pradesh safer in the true sense.

          In Mumbai, a 19-year-old college student was attacked and seriously
          injured by a 35-year-old man she had rejected marriage proposals from
          in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incident occurred on Monday afternoon near the victim Kulsum
          Shaikh&apos;s home in Goregaon East. The accused Sanjay Pralhad Bayas
          allegedly approached Shaikh from behind and slit her throat using a
          blade when she was returning from college.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bayas is a resident of the same Santosh Nagar locality as Shaikh.
          Police said he had proposed to Shaikh before, but she had turned him
          down. This led to quarrels between Bayas and the girl&apos;s family,
          although things had settled later.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Shaikh screamed for help after the throat slitting, Bayas escaped
          from the scene. Shaikh was rushed to the hospital in critical
          condition. Once she stabilized, her statement was recorded and a case
          was registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaikh sustained a deep wound requiring four stitches. Police suspect
          Bayas was intoxicated during the attack. He was arrested on Tuesday
          and charged with attempt to murder.
        </p>
        <p>
          This appears to be an instance of intimate partner violence due to
          masculine resentment against rejection. Attacking a woman for denying
          a romantic or matrimonial alliance points to a patriarchal mindset
          that women&apos;s choices should be dictated by men.
        </p>
        <p>
          The extreme method of slitting the throat also indicates premeditation
          and intention to grievously hurt or kill. Shaikh is fortunate to have
          survived the assault. Considering her young age and the trauma of this
          experience, her emotional recovery may require time and counselling.
        </p>
        <p>
          While intimate partner violence often takes place within homes, this
          incident in a public space in broad daylight is alarming. It
          highlights the sense of impunity emboldening perpetrators to commit
          such crimes openly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective law enforcement can create deterrence against gender-based
          violence. Sensitizing the police to respond swiftly and sensitively to
          such complaints is vital. But preventing such violence requires
          addressing systemic social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maharashtra records among the highest cases of crimes against women
          annually. While laws and policing are tightening, mindset change
          through education and awareness is equally critical. Boys and men must
          be oriented on respecting women&apos;s consent and choices from a
          young age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rejecting a romantic interest or proposal does not imply an affront to
          male dignity. Rather, accepting a woman&apos;s decision with grace
          demonstrates strength of character. Society must reinforce such
          progressive attitudes at homes, schools and through public campaigns.
