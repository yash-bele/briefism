          In North Delhi, a tragic incident occurred on the night between Monday
          and Tuesday, resulting in the death of a 40-year-old man and injuries
          to four others when his car collided head-on with another vehicle near
          the Geeta Colony Flyover.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a Delhi Police official, preliminary findings suggest
          that the accident occurred due to poor visibility on the road, and
          they were notified about the incident at 1:30 am.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collision occurred on Salim Garg Road near Jheel Cut, just before
          the Geeta Colony Flyover in the Kotwali area, as reported by Manoj
          Kumar Meena, DCP (North). At the scene, both vehicles, a Celerio and a
          Swift, both displaying license plates, were found significantly
          damaged.

          Upon initial investigation, it was revealed that the Celerio was
          struck by the Swift from the opposite carriageway, causing substantial
          damage to the central road divider. The driver of the Swift,
          identified as Gaurav Malhotra from Laxmi Nagar, lost his life in the
          collision.
        </p>
        <p>
          DCP Meena further stated, &quot;Four other individuals, namely Sumi,
          Saurav, and two unidentified persons, sustained injuries. One of them
          is in critical condition and has been admitted to the Trauma Centre. A
          case has been registered against unknown persons under the sections of
          causing death due to negligence and rash driving of the IPC (Indian
          Penal Code).&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The tragic incident highlights the dangerous consequences of the
          collision, with one fatality and multiple individuals grappling with
          injuries. The authorities are actively investigating the case,
          focusing on potential negligence and reckless driving as contributing
          factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This unfortunate event serves as a somber reminder of the importance
          of road safety and the need for heightened awareness, especially
          during periods of low visibility. As the investigation unfolds,
          authorities will likely seek to determine the exact circumstances
          leading to the collision and hold those responsible accountable for
          the tragic outcome.

          The film, produced and distributed by Sony Pictures Films India
          Private Limited, featuring Mrunal Thakur, Abhimanyu Dassai, and Paresh
          Rawal, was released in November of the preceding year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dehadrai argued that the entire film contained highly offensive
          references, describing it as a comedy with an exceptionally
          distasteful portrayal of individuals with permanent disabilities. He
          emphasized that the film perpetuated negative stereotypes, deviating
          from its intended comedic nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite these claims, the Delhi High Court declined to entertain the
          plea. The court&apos;s decision signifies a legal stance against the
          petitioner&apos;s argument that the film violated the rights of
          individuals with disabilities, as outlined in the RPwD Act. The
          court&apos;s rejection implies that, based on their evaluation, the
          film does not appear to infringe upon the legal provisions intended to
          protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This legal development highlights the challenges in navigating the
          intersection of artistic expression and potential societal impact,
          especially when it comes to sensitive subjects like disabilities.
          While the petitioner raised concerns about offensive portrayals and
          perpetuation of negative stereotypes in the film, the court&apos;s
          decision signals a subjective interpretation of the content within the
          framework of existing laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          As debates around creative freedom and responsible representation in
          the entertainment industry continue, legal cases like these underscore
          the importance of finding a balance between artistic expression and
          ensuring that content does not compromise the dignity and rights of
          specific communities. The court&apos;s decision serves as a precedent
          in addressing such concerns within the evolving landscape of media and
          entertainment law.

          In anticipation of unemployment emerging as a pivotal issue in the
          upcoming 2024 elections, the Sangh Parivar is actively steering the
          narrative away from mere job seeking. Over the past two years, a
          concerted effort has been made to emphasize self-employment and guide
          young individuals in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          In sync with the government&apos;s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the
          Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) launched its Swavalambi Bharat
          Abhiyan on January 12, 2022. This initiative, led by the economic wing
          of the RSS, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), aims to inspire youth to
          become entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last two years, the SJM and affiliated organizations within
          the RSS have organized 4,413 programs across 511 districts, involving
          over 82,000 youths, collaborating with 400 industrial units, and
          honoring 3,938 entrepreneurs. Additionally, 448 Zilla Rozgar Kendras
          (district employment centers) have been established to assist young
          entrepreneurs in securing funds, arranging necessary training,
          providing legal guidance, and facilitating government clearances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ashwani Mahajan, the national co-convenor of SJM, underscores the need
          to shift the mindset from job-seeking, attributing the inclination
          towards government jobs to policies initiated by Jawaharlal Nehru.
          Mahajan contends that with millions entering the job market annually,
          neither the government nor multinational corporations can provide
          employment opportunities for everyone. The solution, according to him,
          lies in fostering entrepreneurship and revitalizing India&apos;s
          historical legacy as a land of entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of their strategy, the SJM has conducted Entrepreneur
          Development Programs in 2,701 high schools and intermediate colleges,
          1,555 institutions and colleges, and 155 universities. The focus is on
          nurturing the risk-taking ability of young individuals by sharing
          success stories of fellow entrepreneurs and facilitating fund-raising
          through various channels such as private equity funds, government bank
          loans, and Mudra loans. The SJM aims to create an ecosystem that
          sustains entrepreneurial growth with collaboration from diverse
          sections, including politicians and corporates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous organizations affiliated with the Sangh Parivar, such as the
          Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Laghu Udyog Bharti,
          and others, are actively involved in this endeavor. External
          contributors include Zoho Corporation, Gayatri Parivar, Kaneri Math,
          and several more, showcasing a wide-ranging collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahajan highlights the establishment of numerous entrepreneurial
          ventures, including tailoring centers, beauty parlors, computer
          centers, Krishi Vikas Kendras, and Farmer Producer Organizations
          (FPOs) across the country over the past two years. To complement these
          efforts, the SJM has published multiple books on the theme of
          self-employment and even released a song titled &quot;Hum sabko aage
          badhna hai&quot; (We all have to advance), sung by playback artist
          Kailash Kher. The multifaceted approach aims to foster a culture of
          entrepreneurship and address the challenges posed by unemployment.

          In Karnataka&apos;s Haveri district, two men affiliated with a group
          accused of assaulting a Muslim woman and a Hindu man on January 8 are
          facing fresh charges in an assault case involving a 19-year-old woman
          in the same area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 19-year-old Muslim woman experienced an assault by these men,
          accompanied by three others, in the first week of January. The
          incident came to light after police discovered videos of the attack.
          In the January 8 incident at a hotel in Hanagal, the accused recorded
          a video of their assault on the interfaith couple, circulating it on
          social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yallappa Hiraganavar, an officer from the Hanagal police station,
          filed a complaint against Aftab Maqbool Ahmed, a 24-year-old mechanic,
          and Mardansab Mohammed Isaq Mandakki, a 23-year-old merchant, along
          with three others—Mehaboob Ali Gaffarsab Savikeri, Sahib Channapur,
          and Tanveer Gouda, all residents of Hanagal—for attacking the
          19-year-old woman. Ahmed and Mandakki are already in police custody
          over the January 8 attack and the alleged gangrape of a 26-year-old
          married Muslim woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a new police complaint registered on January 14 at the
          Hanagal police station, the 19-year-old woman was allegedly abducted
          by the gang on January 4 between 12 noon and 3 pm after she got off a
          bus. The gang purportedly outraged the modesty of the young woman and
          threatened her with dire consequences if she spoke out about the
          attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the complaint, the gang is said to have interrogated her about a
          man she was traveling with on the bus and whether she had willingly
          gone with him. They recorded a video of the moral policing incident
          and shared it on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, between January 10 and 14, Haveri police arrested seven men
          in connection with the January 8 assault case. Anshu Kumar,
          Superintendent of Police, Haveri, confirmed these arrests during a
          press briefing on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial FIR in the case was filed on January 10 by the Hanagal
          police, prompted by a room boy at the Idigas Lodge. The interfaith
          couple had refrained from filing a complaint due to fears of
          repercussions from their spouses.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, during a court appearance, the woman stated that she was also
          raped by the gang, who took her away after storming into their hotel
          room. The police subsequently invoked charges of gang rape against the
          accused based on the woman’s allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the seven men arrested for the January 8 incident is an
          autorickshaw driver named Abdul Khadar Jaffarsab, 28, who reportedly
          served as an informant to the gang about the interfaith couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police are investigating if some of the accused are involved in
          additional attacks on women under the guise of moral policing in the
          region. The accused have allegedly recorded videos of their assaults
          and shared them on social media, prompting the police to suspect that
          they may have been engaged in such crimes in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          These moral policing incidents, typically associated with right-wing
          groups in coastal Karnataka, have taken a political turn in Haveri.
          BJP leaders have criticized the ruling Congress government, with
          former chief minister and senior BJP leader Basavaraj Bommai, who
          hails from Haveri, alleging double standards in the state
          government&apos;s approach to tackling moral policing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bommai has demanded the creation of a Special Investigation Team to
          look into these cases and has accused the police of attempting to
          downplay the case by taking down a statement that did not include
          gangrape allegations. The situation raises concerns about the
          prevalence of moral policing, the safety of individuals in the region,
          and the effectiveness of the current legal system in ensuring justice
          for survivors. The involvement of political figures and potential
          manipulation of the legal process further underscore the need for a
          comprehensive examination of the root causes and factors contributing
          to such crimes.

          about the Ram Mandir consecration event.

        <p>
          The suo motu case against the MP was filed by a police sub-inspector
          attached to the Kumta police station. The complaint alleges Hegde was
          recorded on video making provocative statements against other
          religious groups in a speech to BJP workers and supporters on January
          13th.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his address, the far-right MP called for demolishing several
          mosques in Karnataka, similar to Babri Masjid, claiming they were
          constructed over Hindu temples. The BJP had distanced itself from
          Hegde&apos;s comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Some people can take it as a threat also. We will definitely do
          it. This is a decision of the Hindu community, not of Anantkumar
          Hegde,&quot; he stated at the Kumta meeting on Saturday. &quot;...in
          every village of the state there are small religious places which were
          violated. Until they are demolished, the Hindu community will not sit
          idle....,&quot; he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Revenge, revenge, revenge. If we do not take revenge for 1,000
          years, then the Hindu community can clearly say that this is not Hindu
          blood. We are not a community which will be in debt. We will clear the
          debt at any cost,&quot; Hegde emphasized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police complaint registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections
          153, 153A and 505 quotes Hegde&apos;s statements verbatim for making
          inflammatory remarks and fomenting enmity between groups.

        <p>
          A five-time BJP MP, Anantkumar Hegde is a prospective BJP Lok Sabha
          candidate from Uttara Kannada for the upcoming elections. He had been
          inactive in public life the past couple of years owing to illness. In
          the past few weeks, Hegde resumed meeting people to secure candidature
          again.

          This is not the first time Hegde has stirred controversy with his
          hardline remarks. In 2017, as a Union Minister, he sparked outrage by
          terming secularists as &quot;people without parentage&quot;.
          Previously in 2016, he had equated Islam with terrorism.

          The latest case underscores tensions between Hindu nationalist
          politicians and minority groups in Karnataka. It evokes memories of
          the contentious Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 by Hindu nationalist
          mobs who claimed the 16th century mosque was built over a temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          By calling for similar demolitions, Hegde&apos;s rhetoric threatens to
          inflame communal tensions in the state along religious lines. It also
          contradicts the BJP&apos;s official stance of distancing itself from
          his comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Hegde retains significant support among hardcore Hindu
          nationalists and right-wing voters. Despite past controversies, he was
          appointed a central minister and may be renominated for the Lok Sabha
          polls. This highlights the sway of extremist politicians within the
          party.
        </p>
        <p>
          But such figures also damage the BJP&apos;s image among moderate
          voters and minorities. With Karnataka being a communally sensitive
          state, Hegde&apos;s fiery rhetoric has the potential to stir social
          disharmony during election season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police case indicates authorities are taking his remarks seriously
          given their provocative nature. But it remains to be seen whether
          Hegde will face any meaningful censure from within his party or
          criminal charges for his latest outburst.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fate will be an important test of how far the BJP is willing to go
          to contain fringe extremist voices while still harnessing their
          support during elections. It will also determine whether the party
          prizes broader social harmony over consolidating a hardline
          majoritarian voter base.
