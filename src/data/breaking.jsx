        <p>
          Following recent outbreaks of violence, 32 of the 60 members of the
          Manipur Legislative Assembly came together on Sunday to unanimously
          adopt several resolutions. These included calls to immediately revoke
          Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreements with armed militant groups
          accused of killing civilians, and to replace the Assam Rifles
          paramilitary force.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The joint statement and demands come as a special delegation from the
          Union Home Ministry arrived in Manipur to hold talks between the
          Meitei and Kuki ethnic communities. Tensions between the groups have
          been high since clashes began in May of last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legislators argued that the immunity provided by SoO ceasefire
          pacts with Kuki militants is enabling unchecked violence and a
          “never-ending cycle” of attacks on civilians. They stated that any
          militant signatories found to be “indulging in killing of innocent
          civilians and violation of ground rules” should have their SoO
          protections abruptly terminated.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, the lawmakers said that SoO agreements set to expire on
          February 29, 2024 should not be renewed for separatist groups also
          engaging in anti-state activities.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the joint statement called for a “complete disarmament”
          of all unauthorized weapons across Manipur by central and state
          security forces. It described recent RPG attacks on Indian soil and
          citizens by Myanmar-based militants as unacceptable and damaging to
          India’s prestige if allowed to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legislators also accused the Assam Rifles paramilitary force of
          being unresponsive and acting as “mute spectators” during frequent
          civilian shootings. They argued the Assam Rifles leadership should be
          held accountable and considered replacing the force with units willing
          to return fire when civilians are under attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the lawmakers, the lack of appropriate reaction by
          current forces to safeguard Manipuri civilians has shattered public
          faith and trust. They urged the central government to take action
          promptly, warning they will consult the public on next steps if
          demands go unheeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strongly-worded resolution underscores the Manipur Assembly’s
          mounting frustration with worsening law and order. The unified front
          presented by lawmakers across party lines sends a clear signal that
          the state government will not tolerate further violence from
          militants.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Their call for revoking SoO immunity agreements suggests existing
          ceasefire pacts have failed, only enabling separatists without
          supporting peace. Meanwhile, criticism of Assam Rifles highlights
          perceived security failures that have left civilians vulnerable amidst
          the unrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          As tensions threaten to spiral further out of control, the lawmakers’
          tough stance aims to reinforce that peacebuilding must remain on
          track. Their demands compel both militant groups and central forces to
          uphold their duties in protecting innocent lives. With Manipur’s
          leadership speaking as one, the onus now falls on New Delhi to respond
          decisively to early signs of a dangerous breakdown in stability.

          Israeli forces launched a major offensive in Gaza overnight, with
          airstrikes, ground troops and naval bombardments targeting the
          southern city of Khan Younis. At least 50 Palestinians were killed in
          the heavy fighting, marking the deadliest clashes so far this month as
          Israel expands its incursion into the Gaza Strip.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          According to residents and journalists, Israeli troops stormed the
          Al-Khair hospital in Khan Younis, arresting medical staff and leaving
          the wounded without access to urgent trauma care. Forces also
          surrounded another hospital, al-Amal, cutting it off from contact.
          Last week, Israel began a major push to capture Khan Younis which it
          says is the main base for Hamas militants who were behind rocket
          attacks on southern Israel in October that killed 1200 Israelis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intense bombardment forced thousands of terrified Palestinian
          families to flee south along the coastal road. Many had to abandon
          their homes and possessions, loading whatever they could carry onto
          donkey carts or vehicles. The United Nations estimates 85% of
          Gaza&apos;s 2.3 million residents have now been displaced, with a
          quarter facing starvation.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Israel&apos;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue
          the offensive until there is &quot;complete victory&quot; over Hamas.
          He also aims to secure the return of around 100 Israeli hostages still
          being held captive in Gaza. However, Netanyahu faces growing pressure
          from relatives of the hostages to negotiate a prisoner swap deal with
          Hamas.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The United States called on Israel to take measures to protect
          innocent civilians, medical staff and patients as it conducts
          operations in Gaza. White House spokesperson John Kirby acknowledged
          Israel&apos;s right to self-defense but emphasized the need to act
          lawfully and avoid harm to hospitals and people seeking care.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to reports, Israel recently put forward a proposal to pause
          military action for up to two months in exchange for a phased release
          of the remaining 136 Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The offer was
          reportedly submitted through Egyptian and Qatari mediators. While it
          does not fully meet Hamas’ demand to end the war, it goes further than
          previous Israeli proposals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk was in the region this week
          holding talks aimed at advancing a hostage exchange deal.
          Communication services in Gaza have been severely disrupted due to the
          fighting, cutting off residents from the outside world.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          A group of relatives of the Israeli hostages stormed a parliamentary
          session in Jerusalem demanding more action to free their loved ones.
          Around 20 family members held up photos, signalling growing domestic
          pressure on Netanyahu four months into the conflict with Hamas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan stated the
          kingdom will not normalize ties with Israel or fund Gaza’s
          reconstruction without a credible path forward for Palestinian
          statehood. His remarks underscored tensions between Israel and allies
          like Saudi Arabia and the US over the Gaza crisis and Netanyahu’s
          rejection of a two-state solution.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          As the civilian death toll rises, Israel faces heavy international
          criticism over the Gaza offensive. But Netanyahu has remained
          steadfast, arguing military control is the only path forward despite
          the toll on Gazans. With no end in sight, the standoff has damaged
          Israel’s alliances. Saudi condemnation highlights how the ongoing
          impasse over Gaza’s future has strained even its staunchest regional
          partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          With pressure mounting on all sides, the coming weeks could prove
          decisive. Israelis demand the safe return of hostages held in Gaza but
          lack confidence in the government’s approach. Gazans urgently need
          humanitarian relief but remain subject to devastating Israeli
          bombardment. And the US and allies like Saudi Arabia are losing
          patience with Netanyahu’s hardline strategy. Compromise to end the
          bloodshed seems elusive but a tipping point may soon be reached,
          forcing all sides toward a resolution.

        <p>
          Former president Donald Trump is now set to testify on Wednesday in
          writer E. Jean Carroll&apos;s ongoing civil defamation trial in
          Manhattan federal court. The trial was postponed for two days earlier
          this week due to COVID-19 concerns after one juror fell ill and
          Trump&apos;s lawyer, Alina Habba, came down with a fever after
          potential exposure.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The case focuses on Trump&apos;s public denial in June 2019 of
          Carroll&apos;s claim that he sexually assaulted and raped her in a
          Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid 1990s. A separate jury
          previously found Trump liable for defamation and awarded Carroll $5
          million in damages related to a similar denial he made in October
          2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the current trial, the nine jurors will only decide how much
          additional money, if any, Trump should pay Carroll for defamation.
          Carroll, now 80 years old, is seeking at least $10 million in
          compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the COVID-related delay, Habba stated Trump had planned to
          testify after Carroll&apos;s legal team finished presenting their
          case. Trump was also scheduled to be in New Hampshire on Tuesday for
          the state&apos;s Republican presidential primary, where he has been
          leading in early polls.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The GOP nominee will likely go on to challenge current president Joe
          Biden, the expected Democratic candidate, in the 2024 election this
          November.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Carroll&apos;s lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge,
          said her team only had a small amount of additional testimony left to
          present before resting their case. Both Habba and her co-counsel
          Michael Madaio have since tested negative for the virus, though
          neither they nor Trump wore masks in court previously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through his lawyers and in a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump
          has continued vigorously denying Carroll&apos;s accusations and
          maintained he knows nothing about her. He dismissed the trial as a
          &quot;Crooked Joe Biden-inspired Witch Hunt.&quot; The former
          president has also pleaded not guilty in several other ongoing
          criminal cases related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election
          results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier in the trial, Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected Trump&apos;s request
          for a mistrial based on Carroll discussing threats she received after
          publicly accusing Trump of assault. While Trump did attend jury
          selection and the start of the second trial, he is not required to
          testify if he chooses not to.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Carroll&apos;s attorneys have argued Trump may try to cause
          unnecessary chaos if he does testify, perhaps believing it could help
          him politically. Last week, after Carroll&apos;s lawyer claimed jurors
          may have overheard Trump loudly decrying the trial as a &quot;witch
          hunt&quot; and &quot;con job&quot; in the courthouse, Judge Kaplan
          cautioned that he could be removed from court for disruptive behavior.
          Trump responded that he would &quot;love it,&quot; to which Kaplan
          simply replied, &quot;I know you would.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that Trump is slated to take the stand, all eyes will be on
          whether he maintains his adamant denial of Carroll&apos;s story under
          oath or causes an outburst. His testimony may prove pivotal in the
          jury&apos;s decision regarding further financial penalties. For
          Carroll and her lawyers, it marks a long-awaited chance to directly
          confront Trump about his alleged sexual assault and the ensuing
          defamation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of the outcome, the case represents an important milestone
          in Carroll&apos;s multi-year quest to hold Trump publicly accountable
          and fight back against what she sees as his use of power and platform
          to evade consequences and silence victims. Though a polarizing public
          figure, Carroll has underscored that all women deserve justice when
          coming forward with harassment claims, no matter the accused&apos;s
          status or politics.

          Dexter Scott King, the younger son of renowned civil rights activist
          Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, passed away on
          Monday at the age of 62 after a battle with prostate cancer. His wife,
          Leah Weber King, shared that he died peacefully in his sleep at their
          home in Malibu, California. She expressed that despite the challenges
          of his illness, he faced it with strength and courage until the end.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Dexter King was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 30, 1961 and named
          after the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama where
          his father served as pastor early in his career. He was only 7 years
          old when his father was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee.
          The shocking loss of his influential father at such a young age deeply
          impacted Dexter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a statement, his sister Dr. Bernice A. King, who now serves as CEO
          of the King Center founded by their parents, expressed her profound
          heartbreak at losing another sibling. She said she is praying for
          strength during this incredibly difficult time.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Like his father before him, Dexter King attended Morehouse College in
          Atlanta after graduating high school. At the time of his passing, he
          had taken up leadership roles at institutions that preserve his
          father&apos;s legacy, serving as Chairman of the King Center and
          President of the King Estate.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Dexter had also followed in his father&apos;s footsteps as an activist
          and leader in the civil rights movement. He lent his voice and
          influence to important causes and helped ensure new generations could
          learn about and be inspired by Dr. King&apos;s vision for equity and
          justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond his civil rights activism, Dexter King was also an actor and
          portrayed his father in the 2002 TV movie &quot;The Rosa Parks
          Story,&quot; allowing him to deeply connect with his father&apos;s
          story and further share it with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reverend Al Sharpton, prominent civil rights leader and founder of the
          National Action Network, shared a heartfelt statement honoring Dexter
          King. He remarked on the incredible pain Dexter experienced losing his
          father and role model at such a young age. However, instead of letting
          the tragedy break him, Dexter found meaning and purpose in carrying on
          his father&apos;s dreams - dedicating his life to making Dr. King and
          Coretta Scott King&apos;s hopes for the future into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dexter King was preceded in death by his parents and two of his
          siblings, sister Yolanda King who died in 2007, and younger brother
          Martin Luther King III who died in 1968 at only 10 months old.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          He is survived by his wife Leah, daughter Yolanda Renee King, sister
          Dr. Bernice King, brother Martin Luther King III, and other family
          members. The loss of his light at only 62 years old is deeply felt by
          all those who knew and loved him.
        </p>
        <p>
          While mourning his passing, Dexter King&apos;s family, friends and all
          who were touched by his work honoring his father&apos;s memory find
          solace in knowing his spirit lives on. The dream he worked so
          tirelessly for will continue on through new generations he inspired,
          reminding us that Dr. King&apos;s fight for justice and equality
          remains as relevant and vital today as ever.

          The Supreme Court today raised concerns regarding the alleged verbal
          directive from the Tamil Nadu government to prohibit live broadcasts
          of the &apos;Pran Prathishta&apos; ceremony of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya in
          temples across the state. The court emphasized that the state
          government cannot impose such bans based on the argument that Hindus
          constitute a &quot;minority&quot; in certain regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the counsel representing the Tamil Nadu government, the
          bench, comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, asserted
          that the society is homogenous, and permissions for events should not
          be denied solely because of the presence of different communities in a
          particular area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressing disapproval of the alleged general order issued by the
          Tamil Nadu government, the bench labeled such directives as
          &quot;atrocious&quot; and instructed the state authorities not to
          summarily reject permission requests. The court emphasized the need
          for adherence to the law and highlighted that authorities should
          evaluate applications seeking permission for live telecasts and handle
          them in accordance with legal procedures. The court also insisted that
          if a request is denied, proper reasons must be provided for the
          rejection.
        </p>

          The Supreme Court issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu government and
          others in response to a plea filed by BJP&apos;s State Unit Secretary
          Vinoj P Selvam challenging the oral order that banned the live
          telecast of the &quot;Pran Prathishta&quot; ceremony of Ram Lalla in
          temples across the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the proceedings, the Tamil Nadu government asserted that there
          were no such restrictions, emphasizing that there was no ban on live
          telecasts, poojas, archanas, annadhanas, or bhajans during the
          &quot;Pran Prathishta&quot; ceremony of Lord Ram at Ayodhya. The
          government argued that the plea was politically motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Senior counsel Dama Seshadri Naidu, representing the petitioner,
          argued that certain police orders had imposed a ban on live-streaming
          and other religious activities related to the ceremony at
          Ayodhya&apos;s Ram Janmabhoomi Temple. He contended that the orders
          were driven by political motives, alleging a disdain for religion by
          the ruling party.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, representing the Central
          government, expressed shock at the situation and urged the Supreme
          Court to send a strong message to the state government. He emphasized
          that the Constitution of India governs the nation, including the state
          of Tamil Nadu, and stated that religious rituals should not be
          obstructed. Mr. Mehta pointed out that LED screenings in temples were
          being halted in the state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bench sought clarification from the Tamil Nadu government
          regarding the reasons behind the ban and expressed displeasure upon
          reviewing the orders presented by the petitioner&apos;s counsel.
          Justice Datta criticized the notion that denials were based on the
          minority status of certain communities in the requested locations,
          stating that such reasons were &quot;atrocious&quot; and suggested
          that, if followed, they would prevent any procession or ritual across
          the state.
        </p>
        <p>The matter has been scheduled for further hearing on January 29.</p>

          Former cricket stars Virender Sehwag and Shoaib Akhtar entertained
          fans with their hilarious banter in a recent social media post. Akhtar
          shared a video where Sehwag poked fun at the pace legend&apos;s
          famously long run-up.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being rivals on the field, the two share great camaraderie off
          it. &quot;My dear friend Viru @virendersehwag saying how my long
          run-up used to make him wait and distract him,&quot; Akhtar captioned
          the post.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video, Sehwag says he would keep looking down knowing it took
          Akhtar 10-15 seconds to finish his run-up. When asked if it was
          distracting, Sehwag quipped that many thoughts would run through his
          mind - &quot;Will he hit my toes or beamer on my head or hit me
          somewhere else?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sehwag retired as one of India&apos;s most prolific batters with 8,586
          Test runs at a stellar average of 49.34 from 104 matches. He amassed
          8,273 ODI runs from 251 games with a strike rate of 104.33. In 19
          T20Is, he scored 394 runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Akhtar played 46 Tests taking 178 wickets at 25.69. In 163 ODIs, he
          claimed 247 wickets at 24.97 average. He also took 19 wickets in 15
          T20Is for Pakistan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The lighthearted social media exchange gave fans a glimpse of
          Sehwag&apos;s famed wit and sense of humor. It also highlighted the
          warm ties between the two legends who were fierce competitors on the
          field.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Their relaxed banter proves that sportsmanship and camaraderie can
          thrive between rivals beyond retirement. Moments like these are a
          reminder of cricket&apos;s unique power to bridge divides.
        </p>

          respect. Veterans regaling viewers with their anecdotes always makes
          for entertaining content. Akhtar and Sehwag continue to keep their
          fans smiling long after hanging up their boots.

          In a tragic incident, a 42-year-old employee at a convenience store in

          The shooting occurred around 11:30am at a Sunoco gas station shop. The
          store manager followed the alleged thieves in his car to try stopping
          their theft but one of them opened fire, striking and killing the
          employee.

          CCTV footage showed the two men entering the store while the manager
          walked behind with a mop bucket. The men browsed aisles before one
          concealed a bag of chips in his pants. They left without paying after
          several minutes.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The clerk then confronted them outside before getting in his car to
          follow as they walked away. Humble Assistant Police Chief Dan Zientek
          said the victim tried reversing his car when the men began shooting,
          but ended up struck on the median.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 42-year-old was hit by a bullet while in the driver&apos;s seat.
          His car had bullet holes in the windshield and rear window. The
          culprits fled on foot and remain at large.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chief Zientek lamented the tragic loss of an innocent man &quot;just
          trying to work and do their job.&quot; He said the shooters had also
          ruined their own lives and would face jail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The senseless killing over something as trivial as a bag of chips has
          shocked the local community. It underscores the perils of retail work
          in a country awash with guns and gun violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Store employees trying to stop petty thefts should not have to fear
          for their lives. While chasing the shoplifters was ill-advised, it did
          not warrant a death sentence on the spot without trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The culprits must be swiftly brought to justice to send a strong
          message that such trigger-happy violence will not be tolerated. Beyond
          that, there needs to be sensible reform to prevent such needless
          tragedies recurring.
