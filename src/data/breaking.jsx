          US Ambassador to India Eric Garcetti recently emphasized the strong
          and growing relationship between India and the United States. Speaking
          at the USC-India Innovation Summit, Garcetti described the bilateral
          ties as “multiplicative” rather than simply additive. He explained
          that when India and the US collaborate, the result is greater than the
          sum of their individual efforts and capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ambassador outlined four key pillars of the relationship between
          the two countries – peace, prosperity, planet, and people. On peace,
          he noted joint diplomacy efforts at forums like the G20. Regarding
          prosperity, he highlighted cooperation in areas like healthcare. In
          terms of planet, he mentioned aligning priorities on major global
          issues like climate change. And on the people pillar, he noted the
          deep cultural and educational ties exemplified by USC’s engagement
          with India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garcetti shared that when President Biden asked him to take on the
          ambassador role, he emphasized that India was the most important
          country in the world currently. This indicates the great significance
          the Biden administration places on strengthening ties between the two
          nations. The Ambassador said he agreed with this assessment, which is
          why he accepted the position.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the two largest democracies globally, the Ambassador said India and
          the US can demonstrate moral leadership at a crucial juncture.
          Democracies must stand together to uphold ideals like freedom, human
          rights, and the rule of law. Their partnership is not based on mere
          convenience or strategic calculations, but on shared values and a
          lasting friendship. This is embodied in institutions like USC
          fostering innovation and exchange between the two countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Garcetti remarked that 2022 was an unprecedented year in US-India
          relations. He described it not just as a new peak in engagement, but a
          new foundation for the relationship. As India rapidly emerges in
          sectors from healthcare to technology to finance, the two nations now
          have an opportunity to build on this foundation for even greater
          cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ambassador expressed confidence that the best is yet to come in
          India-US relations. As the world confronts dictatorship in some
          regions, the partnership between its two largest democracies serves as
          a moral example. India and the US collaborating as equals can unlock
          solutions to pressing global challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          People-to-people ties, underpinned byIndian-Americans as a vibrant
          bridge, are bringing the two nations closer. Shared values, converging
          strategic interests, and complementary capacities provide a strong
          base. With sound diplomacy and leadership, the multiplicative India-US
          relationship can be a force for good. Both sides must continue
          nurturing it as a priority.

          Immigration Minister Marc Miller. He stated several factors
          contributed to the decrease, including diplomatic tensions between the

          The number of study permits issued by Canada to Indian students saw a
          sharp decline in late 2022, according to recent comments by Canadian
          Immigration Minister Marc Miller. He stated several factors
          contributed to the decrease, including diplomatic tensions between the
          two countries that led to reduced staff processing the permits in
          India. Fewer Indian students also applied due to the strained
          relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tensions stemmed from Canadian Prime Minister Justin
          Trudeau&apos;s allegation in June 2022 that there was evidence linking
          Indian agents to the murder of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh
          Nijjar in British Columbia. India rejected this claim but the damage
          was done.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, India ejected a majority of Canadian diplomats working in
          the country, severely limiting Canada&apos;s capacity to process study
          permit applications. Specifically, Canada was forced to pull out 41
          diplomats, nearly two-thirds of its staff in India, after orders from
          New Delhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller stated these moves &quot;really halved our ability to process a
          lot of applications from India.&quot; Data shows Indian student
          permits dropped 86% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the
          previous quarter - from 108,940 to only 14,910.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides reduced processing capacity, some Indian students are now
          seeking options in other countries due to recent concerns over
          facilities at some Canadian institutions, according to an Indian
          official. Miller believes permit numbers are unlikely to rebound soon
          given the ongoing diplomatic tensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian students have been the largest group of international students
          in Canada in recent years, making up over 41% of all permits in 2022.
          Their enrollment brings in around $16.4 billion for Canadian
          universities annually. A decline will significantly impact revenues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller mentioned the Canadian government has also been looking to
          reduce overall international student numbers due to factors like
          housing shortages. He stated the volume of students has simply become
          &quot;out of control&quot; and needs major reduction over a short
          timeframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Possible measures include a cap on numbers and changes to make
          post-graduation work permits less generous. There are also plans to
          crack down on substandard &quot;fly-by-night&quot; designated learning
          institutions that have enabled student influx.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, Canada projected roughly 900,000 international students, with
          Indians making up 40% or 360,000. Though Indian permits dropped 4%
          last year, they remained the largest group. Canada clearly relies
          heavily on Indian enrollments for its universities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ongoing diplomatic spat means this crucial source of students and
          revenue is at risk. Unless tensions ease over the disputed murder
          allegations, Indian appetite to study in Canada may wane. And reduced
          processing capacity in India will also deter students due to long wait
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Canada is in a tough position balancing politics, foreign policy and
          its education sector. Allegations of Indian transnational subversion
          have clearly backfired. But both nations have a vested interest in
          restoring relations to revive educational exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miller implied charges in Nijjar&apos;s case could worsen ties
          further. But conversely, if no charges materialize, diplomacy may
          gradually normalize. Canada will likely tread cautiously to avoid
          entirely alienating a key country for its international education
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interim, diversifying student source markets could hedge risks.
          But India will remain integral to Canada&apos;s universities.
          Eventually, pragmatism may override politics to reset the student
          mobility pillars of this important bilateral relationship.

          Indian-American Republican leader Nikki Haley recently rejected the
          notion that the United States has ever been a racist country. Haley,
          who came third in the recent Iowa caucuses, made these comments in an

          MSNBC host Joy Reid, who expressed doubt that Haley could win the
          Republican nomination due to the party&apos;s alleged anti-immigrant
          stance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haley suggested Reid was depicting a distorted version of America,
          very different from her own experiences. She highlighted her own
          journey as the daughter of Indian immigrants who became the first
          female minority governor of South Carolina and later UN Ambassador.
          Haley said this embodied the American dream, not racism.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked directly whether the Republican Party is racist, Haley
          firmly denied it. She stated that America overall has never been a
          racist country. While acknowledging that racism exists and she faced
          it growing up, Haley said the situation today is much better than in
          the past. The goal should be constant progress to create a more just
          society for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haley argued against dividing Americans based on race or gender. She
          expressed passion for ensuring her own children do not feel
          disadvantaged due to their ethnicity or gender. Haley wants them to
          believe that through hard work, they can achieve anything in the US.
          This requires tackling racism but not depicting America as defined by
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her third place finish in Iowa behind winner Donald Trump and
          runner-up Ron DeSantis, Haley said her campaign remains focused on the
          upcoming New Hampshire primary. She aims to maximize her performance
          there to gain momentum. Though she trails in polls, Haley represents a
          rising Indian-American voice in Republican politics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some experts argue Haley’s experiences as a non-white daughter of
          immigrants clashes with trends of nativism and racism within segments
          of the Republican Party. Her denial that America is a racist country
          aims to counter this narrative. Haley contends that the American dream
          is color-blind, with equal opportunity for all who work hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, others contend Republican policies on issues from immigration
          to voting rights uphold systemic inequities. They say Haley downplays
          ongoing discrimination and barriers facing people of color. There are
          also questions whether a majority of Republican voters would back a
          non-white female nominee despite Haley’s qualifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an Indian-American woman, Haley’s political ascent highlights
          increasing diversity in US politics. Her competitive showing in Iowa
          despite a late entry in the primary illustrates her rising stature
          within Republican ranks. But it remains contentious whether Haley
          accurately depicts contemporary America as largely post-racial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coming primaries and election cycle will test Haley’s
          characterization of the US as a land of equal opportunity. Her vision
          contrasts with those emphasizing deep divides and discrimination still
          impacting people of color. How Haley fares with voters of diverse
          backgrounds will reveal which perspective resonates more powerfully.
          But her voice as an Indian-American adds unique texture to the
          national discourse on identity and the American ideal.

        <p>
          Google recently announced that it is eliminating several hundred
          positions from its global advertising sales team. The job cuts are
          targeted at the company&apos;s &quot;large customer&quot; sales unit
          that handles major advertisers.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Google, the goal is to redirect resources to better
          support small and medium-sized businesses on its advertising
          platforms. By downsizing teams focused on large advertisers, the
          company aims to expand teams assisting smaller businesses with their
          digital advertising needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shift aligns with Google&apos;s long-term growth strategy. Small
          and medium enterprises represent a massive collective opportunity
          compared to a relatively small number of large corporations. Enhancing
          services for SMBs can significantly expand Google&apos;s customer base
          over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company expects its increased investment in SMB ad sales teams
          will drive net hiring growth overall this year. The large customer job
          cuts are seen as a reallocation rather than overall downsizing of the
          sales organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google&apos;s announcement did not mention the role of new artificial
          intelligence capabilities in the changes. However, AI is transforming
          the advertising sector, enabling more automated and personalized
          services. This likely factored into Google&apos;s calculation that it
          can serve large customers equally well with fewer staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Google Cloud recently launched new AI tools to help
          retailers with tasks like automated customer service agents and
          product description generation. Generative AI can handle rote sales
          processes to free up human staff for higher-value client interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The capability of AI technologies is advancing rapidly. Google aims to
          take advantage by using them to make its operations more efficient.
          This will reduce costs and allow reallocation of resources to new
          growth areas like SMB advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          These motives likely shaped Google&apos;s decision to eliminate
          positions in the large customer ad sales team. With AI able to
          replicate lower-level sales functions, the company can focus human
          roles on small businesses that require more customized engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The changes come a year after Google laid off around 12,000 staff in
          early 2022, representing about 6% of its global workforce. That move
          aligned with cost reduction efforts in the face of high inflation and
          rising interest rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest job cuts are smaller in scale and more targeted. They
          exemplify how maturing AI capabilities are transforming businesses
          processes and workforce needs across sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This has dual implications. Firstly, automating repetitive tasks
          improves productivity and consumer experiences. But secondly,
          displacement of roles requires transition support for affected
          workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an AI leader, Google aims to harness promising new technologies.
          But it must also ensure its workforce strategies align with its brand
          values around responsible innovation. The path forward entails
          leveraging AI’s benefits while minimising its risks.

          Shortly after winning the Republican presidential primary in Iowa,
          Donald Trump appeared in a New York courtroom on Tuesday for a
          defamation trial brought by writer E. Jean Carroll. The trial centers
          around Carroll&apos;s claim that Trump sexually assaulted her in a
          department store dressing room in the 1990s, which he denied.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her opening statement, Carroll&apos;s lawyer told the jury that
          when Carroll publicly shared her account in 2019, then-President Trump
          used his powerful platform to attack her character and reputation. The
          lawyer argued Trump attempted to humiliate Carroll and destroy her
          credibility in response to her allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carroll is seeking over $10 million in damages. The jury will decide
          how much Trump should pay, not whether the alleged assault occurred or
          if he lied about it. Trump previously lost a separate defamation case
          to Carroll and is appealing the $5 million damages awarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both cases, Trump has denied knowing Carroll and claimed she
          fabricated the encounter to promote her memoir. However, the judge has
          barred him from arguing he did not defame or assault Carroll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trump left the courtroom before Carroll&apos;s lawyer gave opening
          remarks. His attendance demonstrates the legal jeopardy he still faces
          despite leaving office. The trial commences after Trump secured his
          first primary victory in the 2024 Republican nomination race in Iowa.
        </p>
        <p>
          The defamation proceedings will likely revive discussion of the
          decades-old assault allegations against Trump at a sensitive time in
          his political comeback bid. Trump&apos;s credibility among voters and
          ongoing legal issues could emerge as liabilities during the campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Carroll sees the trial as a chance for justice and
          accountability. Though the alleged assault occurred years ago, she
          aims to use the civil lawsuit to send a message about confronting
          abuse of power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case highlights how private figures like Carroll can face
          difficulties getting legal recourse over harassment claims against
          influential public figures. Defamation suits allow alternative avenues
          to dispute denials and mitigate damages to reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, critics argue such cases set risky precedents infringing on
          free speech rights. There are also concerns over using courts as
          forums to litigate alleged sexual misconduct lacking sufficient
