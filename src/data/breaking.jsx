        <p>
          Kenneth Smith, a convicted murderer, has become the inaugural
          individual in the United States to undergo execution by nitrogen gas,
          employing a contentious new method that some experts caution could
          result in severe suffering or even torture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smith, previously on death row for his participation in a 1988
          murder-for-hire plot that claimed the life of Elizabeth Sennett, had
          narrowly escaped lethal injection in 2022. During that attempt, his
          execution was halted when prison staff failed to successfully insert
          two intravenous lines into his veins, a requirement under the
          protocol, managing only to insert one line after an hour of attempts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, Smith faced a different fate: death through exposure to nitrogen
          gas. He was affixed to a mask that delivered pure nitrogen gas for a
          period of up to 15 minutes, cutting off the oxygen supply to his
          brain, leading to unconsciousness and eventual death.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method represents an alternative chosen by some states due to the
          challenges associated with lethal injection, the most prevalent
          execution method in the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          While around half of the US states still retain the death penalty,
          they employ various methods such as hanging, firing squad, or the
          electric chair. However, none of these methods have been declared
          unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court, although some state courts
          have prohibited specific techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lethal injection, introduced in Texas in 1982, has been the preferred
          method, yet it has encountered numerous issues, both practical and
          ethical. Several executions have been mishandled, causing pain and
          suffering to the inmates. Some, like Smith, have faced delays or
          cancellations due to difficulties in locating suitable veins.
          Additionally, certain states have encountered challenges in obtaining
          the necessary drugs for lethal injection, as drug manufacturers refuse
          to sell them for such purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2011, both the UK and the EU have prohibited the export of
          lethal injection drugs, and Pfizer, a major supplier, ceased providing
          them for execution purposes in 2016. Consequently, some states have
          turned to untested or undisclosed drugs from private sources,
          including compounding pharmacies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nitrogen gas has emerged as another option explored by some states.
          Alabama, along with Oklahoma and Mississippi, has sanctioned the use
          of nitrogen gas in executions and defended it against legal
          challenges. Advocates argue that nitrogen gas provides a humane and
          painless method, inducing a state of euphoria and unawareness before
          death. They cite examples of industrial accidents where workers died
          of nitrogen hypoxia without realizing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, critics of nitrogen gas contend that it is an experimental
          and unproven method that could inflict harm and suffering on the
          inmates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Jeff Keller, President of the American College of Correctional
          Physicians, remarked, “It’s an experimental procedure. Many things can
          go wrong.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Deborah Denno, a criminologist at Fordham Law School specializing in
          death penalty methods, emphasized, “The procedure is supposed to be
          painless. But I have to emphasize - that’s in theory.” She pointed out
          that the masks used for nitrogen gas may not fit properly, potentially
          allowing air to leak in, and warned of potential complications such as
          vomiting or survival with brain damage.

          Overnight, a tropical cyclone named Kirrily struck Queensland,
          Australia, leaving tens of thousands of residents without power due to
          damaging winds and heavy rainfall. The cyclone, initially categorized
          as a level two system, made landfall near the tourist town of
          Townsville along the Great Barrier Reef coast on Thursday before being
          downgraded to a tropical low on Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Australia is currently experiencing an El Niño weather event, commonly
          associated with extreme weather phenomena like cyclones, wildfires,
          droughts, and heatwaves. Queensland Premier Steven Miles reported that
          approximately 64,000 people were facing power outages on Friday due to
          the cyclone. Most of the affected areas were in Townsville, and as of
          now, it is uncertain when power will be fully restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          A category two cyclone is considered three levels below the most
          severe category, but it still has the potential to cause substantial
          damage, including to trees, caravans, crops, and boats. The Australian
          weather forecaster indicated that the former cyclone could bring heavy
          rain and possible damaging winds to northern parts of Queensland on
          Friday, with peak gusts around 90 km per hour (55 mph) expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Premier Miles emphasized the high risk of flooding, stating that there
          is still a significant amount of rainfall expected. Prime Minister
          Anthony Albanese mentioned that military personnel are on standby to
          assist with cleanup efforts following Cyclone Kirrily. He acknowledged
          that the residents of far north Queensland have already faced
          challenging conditions in recent times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cyclone Kirrily is the second tropical cyclone to impact the region
          since December, following Cyclone Jasper, which caused widespread
          damage in the area. Additionally, parts of Queensland and its southern
          neighbor, New South Wales, are on high alert for a heatwave, with
          temperatures expected to reach the high forties Celsius in some
          regional areas. In Sydney, the capital of New South Wales,
          temperatures in the west were forecasted to reach 40 degrees Celsius
          (104 degrees Fahrenheit), more than nine degrees above the average
          maximum for January.

          French language learning. Additionally, he emphasized the
          simplification of the visa process for Indian alumni who have studied

          French, to join our universities. Last but not least, we will
          facilitate the visa process for any former Indian students who studied
          in France,&quot; he explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Macron proudly mentioned that France has 35 universities in the QS
          ranking, with about 15 in the Times Higher Education ranking. He
          highlighted the potential for collaboration between India and France,
          expressing the importance of achieving this through exchange and
          cooperation with the younger generation.
        </p>

          &quot;We now have 35 universities in the QS ranking and about 15 in

          young people, in exchange and cooperation, in trust, in
          friendship!&quot; he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September 2023, following the announcement, the French embassy in
          India implemented several measures, including a five-year short-stay
          Schengen visa, to attract more Indian students. These initiatives are
          part of the people-to-people ties envisioned as one of the three
          pillars of the strategic partnership between the two countries.

          Separated at birth, identical twins Amy Khvitia and Ano Sartania
          embarked on a remarkable journey of rediscovery, overcoming a
          childhood marred by abduction and deceit. Their heartwarming reunion,
          prompted by a TV talent show and a TikTok video, sheds light on a
          broader issue in Georgia, where thousands of infants have been
          abducted from hospitals and sold, with cases reported as recently as
          2005.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amy Khvitia and Ano Sartania, who were taken from their mother
          immediately after birth and sold to different families, eventually met
          their birth mother during their quest for answers, bridging the gap in
          their fragmented history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative unfolds when the twins were 12 years old. Amy Khvitia,
          watching Georgia&apos;s Got Talent at her godmother&apos;s house near
          the Black Sea, was astonished to see a girl performing the jive who
          looked identical to her. Rumors circulated, with people questioning
          why Amy was dancing under a different name, but her mother dismissed
          it, attributing it to everyone having a doppelganger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to November 2021, Amy Khvitia posted a TikTok video
          featuring her blue hair and a pierced eyebrow. The video, sent to Ano
          Sartania by a friend who recognized the striking resemblance, marked a
          pivotal moment in their journey. Ano Sartania attempted to find the
          girl, sharing the video on a university WhatsApp group, leading to a
          connection through Facebook when someone familiar with Amy Khvitia saw
          the message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon messaging each other, Amy Khvitia expressed, &quot;I have been
          looking for you for so long!&quot; Ano Sartania reciprocated, &quot;Me
          too.&quot; The realization dawned that both were born in Kirtskhi
          maternity hospital, which no longer exists, and their birth
          certificates indicated birthdays a few weeks apart, seemingly ruling
          out the possibility of being sisters, let alone twins.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unraveling mystery strengthened their bond. Amy Khvitia remarked,
          &quot;Every time I learned something new about Ano, things got
          stranger,&quot; emphasizing the uncanny similarities. Their meeting
          was an emotional mirror reflection – &quot;It was like looking in a
          mirror, the exact same face, exact same voice. I am her and she is
          me,&quot; said Amy Khvitia, while Ano Sartania expressed the
          significance of their connection through a hug, despite her usual
          aversion to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confronting their adoptive families, the twins discovered the shocking
          truth – they had been adopted separately, a few weeks apart, in 2002.
          Ano Sartania, though initially upset with her family, aimed to
          conclude the challenging conversations to facilitate collective
          healing. The birth mother, who they later located, revealed that she
          fell into a coma due to illness after childbirth. Hospital staff
          falsely informed her that the infants had died shortly after birth,

          In summary, Amy Khvitia and Ano Sartania&apos;s journey is a poignant
          tale of resilience, reunion, and the enduring bond between siblings
          separated by deception. The power of social media, TV shows, and their
          unwavering determination brought them together, highlighting the
          broader issue of infant abductions and trafficking in Georgia.

          Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, representing the Hindu party in the
          Gyanvapi dispute, highlighted the Archaeological Survey of
          India&apos;s acknowledgment that a significant Hindu temple existed
          before the current structure was erected.
        </p>
        <p>
          On May 16, 2022, a commission appointed by a local court concluded a
          videographic survey of the Kashi Vishwanath temple-Gyanvapi mosque.
          During the survey, a structure, contested as a &quot;shivling&quot; by
          the Hindu side and a &quot;fountain&quot; by the Muslim side, was
          discovered within the mosque premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          By July 21, 2023, the Varanasi district court ordered a scientific
          survey of the Gyanvapi mosque complex to determine whether it was
          &quot;constructed over a pre-existing structure of a Hindu
          temple.&quot; District and Sessions Judge A K Vishvesha directed the
          Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct a thorough
          investigation at the property in question, which is settlement plot
          number 9130 (Gyanvapi mosque).
        </p>
        <p>
          The ASI&apos;s survey, initially halted by legal challenges from the
          Anjuman Intezamia Masajid Committee for Gyanvapi mosque and the UP
          Sunni Central Waqf Board, resumed on August 4, 2023. The Allahabad
          High Court and the Supreme Court had dismissed pleas against the
          survey. Since then, the ASI teams have been diligently examining the
          campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 11, 2023, the Varanasi district court granted an
          additional week to the ASI to present the findings of the
          court-mandated scientific survey of the Gyanvapi mosque premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latest development occurred on January 25, 2024, when the ASI
          submitted its report to both the Hindu and Muslim parties involved in
          the dispute.

          Despite the Mumbai Police issuing a notice denying permission for a
          hunger strike in the city, Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange Patil
          has declared his intent to proceed with the demonstration at Azad
          Maidan on January 26. As thousands of Maratha protesters join him on
          their way to Vashi Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC),
          Jarange-Patil faced delays due to a massive crowd at his roadshow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scheduled to begin his hunger strike with supporters at Azad Maidan,
          Jarange-Patil and his followers are advocating for Kunbi (OBC) status
          for the Maratha community. In response, the Mumbai Police issued a
          notice under Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code, expressing
          concerns about the potential disruption to Mumbai&apos;s financial
          operations and transportation system if the protesters entered the
          city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police suggested an alternative gathering site at the
          International Corporation Park Ground in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai,
          emphasizing compliance with court orders. The notice highlighted
          restrictions on the size of protests at Azad Maidan and Shivaji Park
          due to space limitations and ongoing government events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the police notice, Jarange Patil affirmed his commitment to
          Azad Maidan, expressing unawareness of any denial of permission. He
          asserted that the protest aims to secure Kunbi status for Marathas
          without disrupting Republic Day celebrations. The organizers in Mumbai
          announced plans for a flag-hoisting ceremony at Azad Maidan to mark
          Republic Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          While a government delegation attempted to dissuade Jarange-Patil from
          marching to Mumbai, he insisted on the Chief Minister and deputy Chief
          Ministers personally engaging in discussions to resolve the issue.
          Addressing concerns raised by the Navi Mumbai police, Jarange-Patil
          stated that local organizers should address route changes and
          reiterated his determination to proceed as planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the police notice, the Mumbai march organizers, led by
          Virendra Pawar, engaged with officials at Azad Maidan police station,
          expressing discontent with the last-minute notice and reaffirming
          their decision to proceed with the originally planned program.
