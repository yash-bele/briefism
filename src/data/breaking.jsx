          Ankita Bhandari, 19, was murdered in September 2022 while working as a
          receptionist in an upscale resort in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand. Since
          then, the murder has taken a new turn, with her mother calling for the
          arrest of a prominent member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party
          (BJP).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother, Soni Devi, reportedly made the claim in a video,
          claiming that BJP MLA Renu Bisht had given the order to destroy
          evidence linked to the murder case by burning the victim&apos;s room
          at the Vanantra Resort, where her daughter worked as a receptionist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that BJP leader Vinod Arya&apos;s son Pulkit and two others
          were arrested following a furious public outcry following the
          disappearance of Ankita, whose body was subsequently discovered in
          Rishikesh&apos;s Chilla barrage. The luxurious resort&apos;s owner,
          Pulkit, is said to have thrown her into the water when she resisted
          being made to serve a VIP guest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl&apos;s mother also claimed that the state BJP secretary, Ajay
          Kumar, had appeared in witness statements nearly a year and a half
          after the crime, and she urged Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar
          Singh Dhami to act right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the intense public outcry surrounding the Ankita Bhandari
          murder case in 2022, the Uttarakhand Police assigned the case to a
          special investigation team (SIT) headed by senior IPS officer P Renuka
          Devi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Declaring that the Dhami government had betrayed her, Soni Devi
          expressed &quot;Arrest Ajay Kumar as it&apos;s evident that his name
          surfaced in the probe as the VIP who visited the resort,&quot; Soni
          Devi stated in the Sunday video statement. It added &quot;Arrest MLA
          Renu Bisht as well as Pramod Kumar, the former SDM, who gave the order
          for a JCB driver to destroy Ankita&apos;s room.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspector General of Police Nilesh Anand Bharne told news agency ANI
          that &quot;no evidence or statement about any VIP was presented during
          the investigation and testimony in court.&quot; He also stated that
          &quot;many serious allegations have been made by Ankita
          Bhandari&apos;s parents in the media and the social media about the
          so-called VIPs.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The accusations made by Ankita&apos;s mother have also been refuted by
          the BJP. &quot;In a fit of rage, Ankita&apos;s parents have made
          accusations, and the Congress party is expressing its frustration over
          electoral setbacks. The BJP leader&apos;s character is being attacked
          by the opposition using Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s remarks as
          cover. The government and the BJP are with the victim&apos;s family
          and justice will be done in the case as it is sub judice.&quot;, news
          reports as such cited a party leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a PTI report, Uttarakhand Congress president Karan Mahara
          shared Ankita&apos;s mother&apos;s video statement and asked,
          &quot;When will Dhami answer our daughter Ankita Bhandari&apos;s
          mother&apos;s tears?&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ankita&apos;s mother further claimed in her statement that his wife
          had been sent to Pithoragarh and that the Dhami government had falsely
          filed a case against social worker Ashutosh Negi, who was assisting
          her in the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;I will sacrifice my life if the case against Negi is not dropped
          soon and his wife&apos;s transfer is not cancelled,&quot; the woman
          declared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahara stated that similar accusations had also been made by
          Ankita&apos;s father in a letter addressed to the Pauri District
          Magistrate, and that the entire incident ought to be looked into under
          the supervision of a sitting High Court judge.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;It is imperative that action be taken against these allegations
          if there is even the slightest degree of truth,&quot; he declared.

          Regarding disqualification petitions submitted by organizations led by
          former chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Shinde, Rahul Narwekar
          rendered a decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Wednesday, the Speaker declared that the Thackeray-led faction had
          not submitted any documentation indicating that a meeting of the Shiv
          Sena&apos;s national executive had taken place to determine which
          faction of the party was the legitimate one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court gave Narwekar another deadline extension on December
          15, ordering him to make a decision on the petitions by January 10.
          The Maharashtra Speaker was initially instructed by a five-judge bench
          led by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud to hear and rule on the
          disqualification petitions within a “reasonable time” in May of last
          year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena broke up in June 2022 when Chief Minister Eknath Shinde
          rebelled against Thackeray&apos;s Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition,
          claiming the backing of 39 of the party&apos;s 55 MLAs in addition to
          10 independent MLAs. In the government, allies included the Congress,
          the Nationalist Congress Party, and the Shiv Sena.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Thackeray faction has demanded the disqualification of Shinde and
          other MLAs. There were 34 such petitions pending before the Speaker in
          total.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Thackeray, had petitioned the Supreme
          Court on the eve of Narwekar&apos;s verdict, citing concerns about a
          recent meeting between Shinde and Narwekar, according to NDTV. This
          was compared by the former chief minister to a &quot;judge meeting a
          criminal.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray charged the Maharashtra
          government of trying to silence the opinions of those outside the
          ruling class ahead of the Speaker&apos;s decision on Wednesday,
          according to ANI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leader of the Nationalist Congress Party and acting deputy speaker
          Narhari Zirwal initiated the disqualification process in June 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Supreme Court ruled in May that former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat
          Singh Koshyari had erred in concluding that the Shinde-led rebellion
          had caused the Thackeray government to lose its majority. However, the
          court further ruled that the Maha Vikas Aghadi could not be reinstated
          after Thackeray resigned without being put to a floor test.

          violence.

          According to AFP, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa declared a state
          of &quot;internal armed conflict&quot; due to the ongoing situation,
          which has resulted in at least 10 deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noboa approved military operations against the nation&apos;s most
          powerful criminal organizations on Tuesday, following the takeover of
          a television studio by masked gunmen and threats made by gang members
          against law enforcement and civilians.

              Gangs that are connected to powerful cartels in Mexico and
              Colombia, most notably Los Choneros, have committed acts of
              violence, including attacking television studios, setting off
              explosions in numerous cities, and kidnapping police officers.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the largest gang in Ecuador, Los Choneros, led by Jose
              Adolfo Macias, also known as &quot;Fito,&quot; escaped, President
              Noboa declared a state of emergency and instituted a curfew for
              the evening hours on Monday.
            </li>
            <li>
              Later, groups affiliated with cartels from Mexico and Colombia,
              including Ecuadorian gangs, detonated bombs in multiple cities and
              kidnapped multiple police officers.

            <li>
              Armed with guns, these gang members broke into a TC television
              studio in the port city of Guayaquil on Tuesday. &quot;Don&apos;t

              Ecuador is a prime target for drug trafficking organizations due
              to its strategic location on the cocaine trade route that connects
              Peru and Colombia.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Ecuador, drug-related violence has been on the rise for a long
              time; between 2018 and 2022, the murder rate quadrupled, peaking
              at over 7,800 killings last year.

            <li>
              In an effort to increase their power and influence, rival gangs
              connected to the cartels in Mexico and Colombia fight for control
              of drug routes and territory in Ecuador.
            </li>
            <li>
              The country&apos;s faltering economy, in addition to extreme

            <li>
              Unrest within Ecuador&apos;s penitentiaries and an inefficient
