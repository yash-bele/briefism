          Three teenage girls from a small rural village in Tamil Nadu were
          determined to overcome the vast distance separating them from their
          beloved K-pop idols in faraway Seoul, South Korea. The sensational
          band BTS had captured their hearts and imaginations. However, the
          girls only managed to get as far as Chennai before their dream
          collided with reality on the second day of their audacious journey.
          Exhausted and out of money, they were discovered by police late at
          night at a railway station near Vellore as they attempted to make
          their way back home. The authorities immediately took the girls into
          protective custody and transported them to a government-run
          children&apos;s shelter in Vellore district.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to officials, the girls&apos; plan was to sail all the way
          to Seoul from a port in Andhra Pradesh, a route they had managed to
          cobble together after extensive online research. But their lack of
          resources and preparation meant this goal was wildly unrealistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three girls come from humble, lower-middle class families in a
          village located in Karur district. One girl&apos;s mother works as a
          teacher at a local village primary school. However, her father suffers
          from mental health issues that impact the family. Another girl has
          separated parents, with her mother barely scraping by as a farm
          laborer. But the third friend comes from a more stable home
          environment, though still modest in means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somehow, despite their economic disadvantages, the girls had
          internet-connected phones at home which appear to have fueled their
          almost obsessive fascination with BTS. They dove deep into the digital
          realm of the band&apos;s online fanbase, teaching themselves what they
          could about Korean language and music. According to the
          district&apos;s Child Welfare Committee Chairman, the girls had
          researched their idols extensively, knowing intricate details about
          each band member down to their hobbies, favorite outfits, and eating
          habits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their passion for the music group seems to have sparked an intense
          longing within the girls to escape the confines of their small village
          and pursue dreams of dance, music, and stardom. This motivation
          propelled them to raid their meager savings, take money from piggy
          banks, and set off on their quest no matter how irrational.
        </p>
        <p>
          After two days of freedom, the harsh realities of the world crashed
          in. The girls&apos; lack of maturity and planning led them to abandon
          their mission once exhaustion and homesickness kicked in. After
          counseling sessions with child welfare authorities, the girls
          expressed regret over their rash actions and promised not to undertake
          such an irresponsible journey again. For now, they wait patiently,
          albeit anxiously, for their parents to come bring them home. The
          counselors aim to provide guidance to the girls and their families
          before allowing them to reunite.

    title: `Bangladesh Holds Elections Amid Opposition Boycott`,
    preArticle: `Three teenage girls from a small rural village in Tamil Nadu were

          As Bangladesh prepares for nationwide elections today, the country is
          on high alert with tightened security measures amid fears of potential
          violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vote holds major significance for India, as Prime Minister Sheikh
          Hasina, a key ally, seeks a fourth straight term while the main
          opposition boycotts the polls. India is closely monitoring this
          electoral process, expected to shape the political landscape of its
          eastern neighbor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies are refusing to
          participate, insisting no fair or credible election can occur under
          the current government. The BNP has called a 48-hour nationwide
          general strike starting this morning through Monday morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          A BNP spokesperson said the strike aims to demand the resignation of
          the &quot;illegal government,&quot; establishment of a nonpartisan
          caretaker government, and release of imprisoned opposition leaders and
          activists. Notably, former premier and BNP leader Khaleda Zia remains
          under house arrest on graft convictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The absence of a formidable challenger paves the way for Hasina&apos;s
          Awami League party to win easily. However, this risks deepening
          authoritarianism in Bangladesh. The BNP argues elections without them
          lack legitimacy. But the Awami League insists people still have
          candidate choices from smaller parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clashes between party supporters this month killed at least six
          people, underscoring tensions. Rights groups decry crackdowns on
          dissent under Hasina, which the government denies. While India has
          concerns about Hasina&apos;s authoritarian streak, it sees her as key
          to providing stability and maintaining close ties.
        </p>

              independent candidates.

              With 11 crore voters participating, the fate of 1500 candidates

        <p>
          On Saturday, a federal appeals court upheld a judge&apos;s decision
          that prevented California from enforcing a recently enacted law
          prohibiting the carrying of firearms in most public spaces, citing its
          unconstitutionality. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a
          previous order that temporarily suspended an injunction against the
          law. The original injunction had been issued by a judge who determined
          that the state&apos;s Democratic-led legislation violated
          citizens&apos; Second Amendment rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earlier order, which had briefly lifted the injunction, allowing
          the law to take effect on January 1, was dissolved by a different
          panel of judges on Saturday in response to a request from gun rights
          groups. CD Michel, legal representative for these groups, stated,
          &quot;So the politicians&apos; attempt to circumvent the Second
          Amendment has been halted, at least for now.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          California&apos;s appeal of the injunction is now scheduled for a
          hearing in April. The state&apos;s attorney general argued in court
          documents that blocking the law would expose tens of millions of
          Californians to an increased risk of gun violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The decision was met with criticism from Daniel Villaseñor, a
          spokesperson for Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who signed the law
          in September. Villaseñor argued that the court&apos;s ruling
          jeopardizes the safety of Californians.
        </p>
        <p>
          The law in question was enacted in response to a significant Supreme
          Court ruling in June 2022 that broadened gun rights nationwide. In the
          case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v Bruen, the
          conservative-majority Supreme Court struck down New York&apos;s
          stringent gun permit system and affirmed the right to carry handguns
          in public for self-defense under the Second Amendment. The ruling also
          introduced a new test for assessing the constitutionality of gun laws,
          emphasizing consistency with the nation&apos;s historical tradition of
          firearm regulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the Supreme Court decision, California, along with other
          states, sought to revise its firearm regulations. Senate Bill 2, the
          contested law in California, prohibited the carrying of concealed guns
          in various &quot;sensitive places,&quot; such as hospitals,
          playgrounds, stadiums, zoos, and places of worship, irrespective of
          concealed carry permits. Additionally, the law restricted concealed
          carry at privately owned commercial establishments open to the public,
          unless the business explicitly permitted license holders to carry
          firearms on the premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          US District Judge Cormac Carney, appointed by former President George
          W. Bush, sided with permit holders and gun rights groups on December
          20, declaring that the law violated the Second Amendment.
