  //       Scientists are learning about the long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2
  //       virus on mental health amidst its ongoing global impact. There may be a
  //       link between Covid-19 and mental health problems, according to recent
  //       research.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       Researchers have discovered a connection between severe Covid-19
  //       infection and schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, in a recent study.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       The results show that individuals with Covid-19 infection have a
  //       diagnosis of schizophrenia that is more than four times higher than that
  //       of those without the infection.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       Researchers from West Virginia University in the US have published in
  //       the National Library of Medicine about a possible interaction between
  //       vaccines and clozapine, a common medication used to treat schizophrenia.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       Although the cause of schizophrenia, a mental illness characterized by
  //       hallucinations and cognitive impairments, is unknown, earlier research
  //       has hypothesized that viral infections may be involved. This theory is
  //       strengthened by the latest discovery, which demands more research.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       The study also made clear how important it is to carefully consider
  //       immunization plans for patients receiving clozapine therapy.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       &quot;According to our data, younger people who have Covid-19 are more
  //       likely to develop SSPD (Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders).
  //       These findings highlight the necessity of careful mental evaluation and
  //       assistance in the Long-Covid era, particularly for younger populations,
  //       and are consistent with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and past
  //       research&quot;, the authors wrote.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       The correlation observed between severe Covid-19 infections and a
  //       heightened likelihood of developing schizophrenia underscored the
  //       pressing requirement for an all-encompassing strategy to tackle the
  //       pandemic&apos;s enduring impact on mental health.
  //       <br />
  //       <br />
  //       Additionally, the study examined how the pandemic affected primary care
  //       providers&apos; ability to provide Brief Interventions (BIs) for alcohol
  //       and tobacco use.
