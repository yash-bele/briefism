        <p>
          The COVID-19 sub-variant JN.1 has now spread to 15 states and Union
          territories across India, with data from the Indian SARS-CoV-2
          Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) recording a total of 923 JN.1 cases
          detected in the country so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karnataka has reported the highest number of JN.1 infections at 214
          cases, followed by Maharashtra with 170 cases, Kerala at 154 cases,
          Andhra Pradesh at 105 cases, Gujarat at 76 cases, and Goa at 66 cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other states like Telangana and Rajasthan have seen 32 JN.1 cases
          each, Chhattisgarh has reported 25 cases, Tamil Nadu 22 cases, Delhi
          16 cases, Haryana 5 cases, Odisha 3 cases, West Bengal 2 cases, and
          Uttarakhand 1 case, as per the INSACOG data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the number of JN.1 cases is steadily rising across
          multiple states and the sub-variant has clearly gained a foothold in
          the country, health officials say there is no immediate cause for
          major concern yet. This is because the majority of those infected with
          JN.1 so far have experienced relatively mild illness and have been
          successfully isolating and recovering at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Centre has still asked all states and Union territories
          to maintain constant vigilance and surveillance amid the recent uptick
          in overall COVID-19 cases nationwide as well as the spread of the JN.1
          sub-variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, states have been urged to ensure effective compliance
          with the detailed operational guidelines for the revised COVID-19
          surveillance strategy that was shared with them by the Union Health
          Ministry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Authorities have also advised states to regularly monitor and closely
          track the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute
          respiratory illness (SARI) cases being reported from all health
          facilities in each district. This is critical to allow for early
          detection of any rising trend of infections.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the World Health Organization (WHO) has designated JN.1 as a
          separate &quot;variant of interest&quot; due to its rapidly increasing
          transmission, it has assessed that JN.1 poses a &quot;low&quot; risk
          to global public health at the current time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to being classified as a distinct variant of interest, JN.1 was
          categorized under the BA.2.86 sub-lineages, which itself is the parent
          lineage that the WHO has designated an overall variant of interest.
