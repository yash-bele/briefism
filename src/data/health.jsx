          Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is essential for immune system

          A deficiency of vitamin A arises from the body not getting enough of
          this vital nutrient. People in developing nations are mainly affected
          by it, particularly in regions where malnutrition is common. Common
          causes include eating a diet low in foods high in vitamin A, having
          digestive issues that impair vitamin A absorption, and having certain
          medical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lack of vitamin A can result in a variety of illnesses and
          disabilities, especially those that affect the eyes. Continue reading
          for a list of the numerous symptoms of a vitamin A deficiency as well
          as advice on how to treat it.

            Suggestions for treating vitamin A deficiency:
          </span>
          <ul className="space-y-1.5 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Eat a diet rich in foods like liver, fish, eggs, dairy, and orange
              and yellow vegetables like sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and carrots.
            </li>
            <li>
              Include leafy greens in your diet, such as kale, collard greens,
              and spinach, as they are rich in beta-carotene, which the body
              uses to make vitamin A.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add fruits that are high in beta-carotene and can help raise your
              vitamin A levels, like oranges, mangoes, and apricots.
            </li>
            <li>
              To help you reach your daily requirements, look for fortified
              cereals, milk, and other food products that are enhanced with
              vitamin A.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider taking a vitamin A supplement under a doctor&apos;s
              supervision if your diet isn&apos;t enough to meet your needs for
              the vitamin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat has the potential to destroy vitamin A, so use caution when
              cooking food to preserve its vitamin A content. Vegetables can
              have their nutrients preserved by lightly steaming or
              stirring-frying them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit or stay away from alcohol completely as it can cause
              problems with the absorption and utilisation of vitamin A.
            </li>
            <li>
              It has been demonstrated that smoking lowers vitamin A levels, so
              giving up can help you keep your body&apos;s vitamin A levels at
              their ideal levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Certain medications, like some acne treatments, can obstruct the
              body&apos;s ability to absorb and use vitamin A. Talk to your
              doctor about any possible medication-induced vitamin A deficiency.
