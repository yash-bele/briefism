          Few foods are as well-known in the world of healthful nutrition as
          oats, which provide a flexible and nourishing supplement to our
          regular diets. Beyond being a breakfast mainstay, oats have become
          well-known for their remarkable health advantages, making them a
          popular option for anyone looking for a nutrient-dense, heart-healthy
          meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oats have many benefits, ranging from supporting heart health to
          helping with weight management, which makes them an important part of
          a healthy, well-balanced diet. We learned about the nutritional
          benefits of oats from Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, a general practitioner and
          the founder and director of the Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals.

          <ul className="space-y-1 list-outside list-disc marker:text-slate-400 ml-4">
            <li>
              Heart health: Beta-glucans, a soluble fiber type found in oats,
              have the ability to lower cholesterol and thus support heart
              health.
            </li>
            <li>
              Blood sugar control: Oats are a good option for people with
              diabetes since their soluble fiber helps control blood sugar
              levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Digestion: The high fiber content of oats promotes a healthy
              digestive system and helps ease constipation. Additionally, it
              encourages fullness, which helps with weight management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Weight management: Oats' high fiber content, which helps regulate
              appetite, can aid in weight loss and management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Absorption of nutrients: Oats are a good source of vitamins,
              minerals, and B-vitamins, which are important for the metabolism
              of energy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Antioxidants: Avenanthramides, an antioxidant found in oats, have
              anti-inflammatory and anti-itching qualities.

          <span className="text-xl">Can someone with diabetes eat oats?</span>
          <p>
            Oats are safe for diabetics to eat because they have a low glycaemic
            index and soluble fiber, which helps to stabilize blood sugar
            levels.

            Oats contain a number of nutrients, including iron and B vitamins,
            which can be advantageous for expectant mothers. But moderation is

            <li>
              Gluten-free oats are the better option for those who are sensitive
              to gluten.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although oats have some natural sugars in them, their total sugar
              content is minimal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Portion control is crucial because overindulgence can result in an
              excessive calorie intake.

        Scientists are learning about the long-term effects of the SARS-CoV-2
        virus on mental health amidst its ongoing global impact. There may be a
        link between Covid-19 and mental health problems, according to recent
        research.
        <br />
        <br />
        Researchers have discovered a connection between severe Covid-19
        infection and schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, in a recent study.
        <br />
        <br />
        The results show that individuals with Covid-19 infection have a
        diagnosis of schizophrenia that is more than four times higher than that
        of those without the infection.
        <br />
        <br />
        Researchers from West Virginia University in the US have published in
        the National Library of Medicine about a possible interaction between
        vaccines and clozapine, a common medication used to treat schizophrenia.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the cause of schizophrenia, a mental illness characterized by
        hallucinations and cognitive impairments, is unknown, earlier research
        has hypothesized that viral infections may be involved. This theory is
        strengthened by the latest discovery, which demands more research.
        <br />
        <br />
        The study also made clear how important it is to carefully consider
        immunization plans for patients receiving clozapine therapy.
        <br />
        <br />
        &quot;According to our data, younger people who have Covid-19 are more
        likely to develop SSPD (Schizophrenia Spectrum and Psychotic Disorders).
        These findings highlight the necessity of careful mental evaluation and
        assistance in the Long-Covid era, particularly for younger populations,
        and are consistent with the known neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and past
        research&quot;, the authors wrote.
        <br />
        <br />
        The correlation observed between severe Covid-19 infections and a
        heightened likelihood of developing schizophrenia underscored the
        pressing requirement for an all-encompassing strategy to tackle the
        pandemic&apos;s enduring impact on mental health.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, the study examined how the pandemic affected primary care
        providers&apos; ability to provide Brief Interventions (BIs) for alcohol
        and tobacco use.
