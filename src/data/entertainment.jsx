          In a heartwarming viral video, pop superstar Taylor Swift and Donna
          Kelce, mother of her boyfriend Travis Kelce, were seen joyfully

              Despite biting winds and below freezing temperatures, Swift made a
              flashy entrance at the NFL Wild Card game in a red puffer jacket
              emblazoned with Kelce&apos;s name and number. Taking her seat next
              to Donna Kelce, Swift faced intense scrutiny after missing the
              Chiefs&apos; last game for the Golden Globes. But she silenced
              critics by not only attending but amping up the energy with her
              festive moves alongside Travis&apos; mom.

              With chatter and cheers filling the air, Swift and Donna Kelce
              finally got quality time together after numerous scheduling
              conflicts kept them apart. Eagle-eyed fans noticed Swift
              strategically placing her hand near her mouth, likely avoiding a
              viral moment à la Selena Gomez at the Globes.

              Earlier, Donna had said she would be in the heated skybox despite
              below-freezing winds and temperatures plunging to -27°C. &quot;I
              have to have a blanket and I’ll have my winter coat on,&quot; she
              stated. This was Swift&apos;s 5th Chiefs game out of 6 at
              Arrowhead Stadium. She told Time Magazine, &quot;By the time I
              went to that first game, we were a couple.&quot; Swift added they
              would never “hard launch a first date” at a game.

            <p>
              Netflix announced the renewal on December 19, 2022 via a special
              video featuring the Walter family and creator Melanie Halsall
              expressing her excitement to explore more of the Walter boys&apos;
              world. With the streaming giant firmly behind the show, fans can
              expect the same high production values and compelling
              storytelling.

              While an exact release date is yet to be confirmed, season 2 will
              likely hit Netflix in 2024 or early 2025 given the long production
              timelines of season 1. Filming and post-production took well over
              a year last time around. But the wait will be well worth it!
