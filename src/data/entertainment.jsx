          Expats, a new miniseries on Prime Video created and directed by Lulu
          Wang, delves into the complex dynamics of women versus husbands,
          children versus parents, and men battling internal conflicts. Drawing
          inspiration from Janice YK Lee&apos;s novel, the show unfolds in
          contemporary Hong Kong, exploring the lives of privileged characters
          grappling with their identities amid societal upheaval.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lulu Wang, known for her acclaimed film &quot;The Farewell,&quot;
          weaves a narrative against the political backdrop of Hong Kong. The
          series navigates a dual narrative, oscillating between a poignant
          exploration of grief and forgiveness and a thrilling plot reminiscent
          of &quot;Big Little Lies,&quot; featuring star and executive producer
          Nicole Kidman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kidman portrays Margaret, an affluent American living with her family
          in Hong Kong. Her neighbor, Hilary, an Indian-American in an unhappy
          marriage to an Englishman named David, connects with Margaret through
          unforeseen circumstances involving Mercy, a young Korean-American
          seeking solace in Hong Kong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The series unfolds with an incident at a boat party, leading to Gus,
          Margaret&apos;s youngest child, getting lost in a night market under
          Mercy&apos;s care. Episode one sets the stage with scandalous
          dynamics, leaving viewers questioning the strained relationship
          between Margaret and Hilary, Mercy&apos;s unexpected role, and Clarke,
          Margaret&apos;s husband, displaying emotional vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the narrative unravels, episode two shifts tone, grounding the
          drama. The standout episode, number five, provides a cinematic
          perspective lasting an hour and 40 minutes. It adopts the viewpoint of
          housemaids, often background characters, who, like their employers,
          are expatriates with limited resources. Wang skillfully explores
          complex dynamics, such as Margaret&apos;s guilt over her
          children&apos;s attachment to their help, Essie, prompting her
          decision to hire Mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The characters&apos; emotional struggles are symbolically confined
          within physical spaces, intensifying their inner turmoil. Noteworthy
          episodes feature Hilary and her Punjabi mother trapped in a lift,
          revisiting past trauma, and Margaret grappling with her beliefs during
          a rainy evening with a pastor. Despite expressions of gratitude toward
          their helps, an invisible wall persists between the characters and
          their domestic staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expats unfolds with six gripping episodes, skillfully written by Wang,
          revealing a nuanced and compelling exploration of complex
          relationships and internal conflicts within the expatriate community
          in Hong Kong.

          As Bobby Deol celebrates his 55th birthday, the success of Sandeep
          Reddy Vanga&apos;s &quot;Animal&quot; has added to the joy. While the
          actor has earned acclaim for various films, his debut in
          &quot;Barsaat&quot; holds a special place. The film, however, faced
          challenges in reaching the big screen, experiencing a tumultuous
          journey from inception to release. Bobby revealed that the initial
          director, Shekhar Kapur, abandoned the project after 27 days of
          shooting, leaving the film in limbo for four years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shekhar Kapur&apos;s departure resulted from an offer to direct
          &quot;Bandit Queen,&quot; leading to changes in the script that left
          Bobby frustrated. The delay prompted his father, Dharmendra, to
          intervene and initiate discussions with Shekhar. At the Jagran Film
          Festival, Bobby shared, &quot;I started shooting for the film very
          early, and Shekhar Kapur was the director. We shot for the film for 27
          days. He then got an offer from Hollywood to make &apos;Bandit
          Queen.&apos; Shekhar said, ‘I will do &apos;Bandit Queen&apos; and
          come back to do &apos;Barsaat.&apos;&apos; But my father told him that
          he didn’t want to delay it. He told Shekhar, ‘You go do your film, I
          will find somebody else.’ And I think Rajkumar Santoshi was waiting to
          direct my film. I got lucky with him.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the stroke of luck with a new director, the script underwent
          significant changes, leading to confusion and exhaustion for Bobby.
          The actor, who was 26 when the film finally released, faced a
          prolonged journey from the age of 22 when shooting began. The script
          alterations compelled Bobby to take up running, playing drums, bike
          riding, and other activities to adapt to evolving character
          requirements. Reflecting on the experience, he expressed, &quot;It was
          frustrating.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Barsaat,&quot; co-starring Twinkle Khanna, was shot in various
          national and international locations, including London, Manali, and
          Italy. Notably, one scene features Bobby fighting a tiger. Recounting
          the daring sequence, Bobby shared, &quot;We shot it in Italy. We
          learned there was someone who had trained Siberian tigers. He had a
          small zoo of his own. I did the fight with the tiger there. They had
          just trimmed his nails. They would have a piece of meat close to my
          neck, so the tiger jumps on you and goes for the meat. I had to stop
          him with my hand. His paws were so heavy that when he would get tired,
          he would place his paws on me, and I would get pushed down.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Bobby&apos;s career encompasses diverse films like &quot;Gupt: The
          Hidden Truth,&quot; &quot;Soldier,&quot; &quot;Dillagi,&quot; and
          &quot;Ajnabi.&quot; Intriguingly, the actor now expresses interest in
          exploring South Indian film industries. His upcoming projects include
          Suriya&apos;s Tamil period film &quot;Kanguva&quot; and Telugu films
          &quot;Hari Hara Veeru Mallu&quot; and an untitled project with
          Nandamuri Balakrishna.

        <p>
          Niharika Konidela, the niece of megastar Chiranjeevi, recently
          discussed her divorce from Chaitanya JV in a podcast with Nikhil
          Vijayendra Simha. The couple, who had a fairy-tale wedding in Udaipur
          in 2020, announced their divorce in July 2023 after rumors of their
          separation emerged a year later. Niharika opened up about the
          emotional pain she experienced after the divorce, emphasizing the
          importance of being independent and focusing on self-growth before
          entering into a new relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a podcast clip shared by Nikhil, Niharika expressed, &quot;I am at
          a stage in life where I want to focus on myself, I also want to be
          there for my parents. You can’t be dependent on the wrong person. I’ve
          been divorced for almost two years now, only I know how much it hurt
          me.&quot; She acknowledged the support of her father Nagababu, who
          encouraged her to prioritize her happiness and highlighted the lessons
          her divorce taught her about the value of family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding to her perspective, Niharika, who is 30 years old, emphasized
          that while she hasn&apos;t closed off her heart to love, she wants to
          be independent and work on herself before committing to a new
          relationship. She stated that, for now, she is single.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the podcast, Chaitanya responded to the discussion by
          advising the podcast host not to present only one point of view. He
          appreciated the effort to address unfair negativity surrounding
          Niharika but urged against using the platform to indirectly attach
          tags of victimhood or causality to their marriage. Chaitanya
          emphasized the shared pain of the separation and the healing process
          for both parties, suggesting that discussions about the aftermath and
          healing are acceptable but should not involve indirect implications or
          one-sided narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaitanya concluded his comment by expressing the need for a
          comprehensive understanding of the situation and discouraging judgment
          without knowledge of the complete picture. His response garnered
          support from numerous netizens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The public exchange sheds light on the challenges and emotions
          involved in navigating a high-profile divorce, with both Niharika and
          Chaitanya sharing their perspectives on the separation and its
          aftermath. The open discussion brings attention to the complexities of
          personal relationships and the importance of respecting privacy and
          healing during such challenging times.

          HanuMan director Prashanth Varma has achieved remarkable success with
          his recent release, surpassing the challenges faced by Telugu stars
          Prabhas and Om Raut in their film Adipurush. Despite the significant
          difference in scale, HanuMan has emerged as a massive hit. In a recent
          interview, Prashanth shared his perspective on Adipurush, not holding
          back his opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adipurush faced criticism for its visual effects and dialogues. When
          asked if he considered Adipurush a lesson in what not to do in his own
          film, Prashanth Varma responded, &quot;Not at all. Whether that film
          happened or not, I would have made HanuMan just the way it is now.
          Those are the mistakes I would never make, irrespective of that film.
          That&apos;s not my style of filmmaking, and it&apos;s not in line with
          who I am as a person. Adipurush didn&apos;t affect my filmmaking
          process at all.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          He emphasized, &quot;I would never do that.&quot; When questioned
          further about whether Adipurush had any impact on him, Prashanth
          explained, &quot;To be frank, there were a few sequences in the film
          where I went &apos;woah&apos;... they were so good. I could never have
          done this. Credit should be given for that. At the same time, there
          were sequences that hurt me. I thought, &apos;I would have done it
          differently.&apos; Every filmmaker feels that way. As an audience, I
          couldn&apos;t agree with some aspects, but there were also some
          brilliant sequences.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          HanuMan, starring Teja Sajja and Amirtha Iyer in lead roles, has
          achieved tremendous success at the box office, surpassing Rs 230 crore
          in just 13 days. Its box office performance has even surpassed that of
          Mahesh Babu&apos;s Guntur Kaaram, surprising the industry. Prashanth
          Varma has already initiated the pre-production for the sequel to
          HanuMan, envisioning it as a major franchise.

          Following a substantial but not exceptional opening day collection of
          Rs 24 crore, the high-budget film &quot;Fighter,&quot; starring
          Hrithik Roshan, experienced a significant surge on its second day.
          Benefiting from positive reviews regarding the film&apos;s aerial
          action sequences, Fighter is estimated to have witnessed a surge of
          over 70%, earning Rs 39 crore on its second day of release, which
          coincided with Republic Day. This brings the film&apos;s two-day
          domestic total to Rs 61 crore, and it is anticipated to achieve a
          domestic opening weekend collection ranging from Rs 120 crore to Rs
          150 crore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by Siddharth Anand, Fighter is a patriotic action film that
          explores the lives of Air Force fighter pilots during a period of
          conflict. Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor play supporting roles,
          along with Karan Singh Grover and Akshay Oberoi. According to Sacnilk,
          Fighter reported a 41% occupancy for the standard 2D version and a 42%
          occupancy for the 3D version. Evening shows attracted the most viewers
          for both versions of the film. Mumbai and the Delhi NCR region
          reported an occupancy of around 50%, while Chennai reported over 80%
          occupancy but from very limited shows. Despite recent trends, Fighter
          is not being marketed as a pan-India film.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the opening day collections of the film did not reach the high
          standards set by Hrithik in his recent career – his two previous films
          with Siddharth Anand had larger debuts – they signaled a return to
          form for the star, whose last release, Vikram Vedha, was perceived as
          underperforming. Vikram Vedha concluded its domestic run with around
          Rs 80 crore, a figure that Fighter is expected to surpass on day
          three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hrithik&apos;s highest opening remains War, which earned Rs 53 crore
          in 2019 and went on to gross around Rs 470 crore worldwide. Bang Bang
          debuted with Rs 27 crore and grossed over Rs 350 crore globally.
          Siddharth, Deepika, and Anil Kapoor are all coming off major hits.
          While Siddharth and Deepika also collaborated on the Shah Rukh
          Khan-starrer Pathaan, Anil was recently featured in the controversial
          blockbuster Animal. Fighter is anticipated to maintain its strong
          performance over the weekend.

          The latest season of Shark Tank India has sparked discussions among
          viewers, particularly drawing attention to one of the new
          &quot;sharks,&quot; Deepinder Goyal, the founder of Zomato. A video
          clip has been circulating, showcasing Goyal providing feedback to the
          team from WTF Fitness during their pitch, and it has led to
          comparisons with the previous judge, Ashneer Grover.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the promotional video, Goyal can be seen critiquing the WTF Fitness
          team for their lack of attention to detail in presenting their
          business idea. He pointed out various mistakes in their pitch,
          emphasizing the importance of paying attention to details and showing
          respect to customers and partners. Goyal questioned why the phone
          number mentioned had nine digits instead of the standard ten and
          highlighted a grammatical error in the phrase &quot;India’s
          Most.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Why does the &apos;M&apos; in &apos;Most&apos; have a capital
          letter? You are incorporating grammar into the AI model?&quot; Goyal
          remarked. He further expressed his disappointment, stating, &quot;This
          is your showcase; you are appearing on TV. Don’t you love your brand
          enough? Show some love and respect to your customers. If there is a
          typo in a CV, it gets swiped left in less than two seconds. Why did
          you get more than two seconds? It is because you are on national
          television.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans of the show praised the latest episode, with some expressing that
          it was an improvement over the previous one. One viewer mentioned,
          &quot;A breath of fresh air in a dying show without Piyush &
          Ashneer.&quot; Another fan commented, &quot;Ashneer has said he
          learned business from Deepinder. Now, we can see for ourselves what
          effect he has had on Ashneer.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ashneer Grover was a popular judge in the first season of Shark Tank
          India. However, due to issues with his former company BharatPe, a
          fintech firm he co-founded, he did not continue as a judge in
          subsequent seasons. The current season features other judges,
          including Anupam Mittal, Namita Thapar, Vineeta Singh, Aman Gupta, and
          Riteish Agarwal, among others.

          The teaser of &quot;Shaitaan&quot; commences with an eerie narration
          proclaiming, &quot;They say the world is deaf, yet they listen to
          every word of mine. I am darkness. I am the bowl of temptation.&quot;
          As the voice, describing itself as the &quot;owner of nine
          hells,&quot; &quot;night,&quot; &quot;twilight,&quot; and
          &quot;curse,&quot; continues, the background score intensifies. The
          teaser alludes to the film&apos;s dark and spooky elements but
          refrains from revealing anything about the plot.

          Towards the end, the voice introduces a game, offering a glimpse of a
          frightened Ajay Devgn and Jyotika, alongside a black voodoo doll.
          Madhavan&apos;s wicked laughter at the conclusion adds an eerie touch.
          The teaser comes with the caption, &quot;Woh poochega tumse… ek khel
          hai, kheloge? Par uske behkaave mein mat aana! (He will ask you to
          play a game, but don’t get tempted).&quot;

          Ajay Devgn had announced &quot;Shaitaan&quot; a week earlier. The

          produced by Ajay Devgn, Jyoti Deshpande, Kumar Mangat Pathak, and
          Abhishek Pathak. Notably, the film marks Jyothika&apos;s return to
          Hindi cinema after almost 25 years. She initiated her acting career
          with the 1997 Hindi film &quot;Doli Saja Ke Rakhna&quot; and later
          starred in the 2001 Bollywood drama &quot;Little John.&quot;

          Before unveiling the teaser, Ajay Devgn shared the first look poster
          of &quot;Shaitaan,&quot; featuring himself, Jyotika, and Madhavan.
          While Devgn and Jyothika appear frightened, Madhavan sports a devilish
          smile. Devgn wrote, &quot;#Shaitaan is coming to cast a spell on
          you,&quot; along with the poster. Madhavan added, &quot;#Shaitaan
          nazar milata nahi – nazar lagata hai. (The devil doesn’t look at you,
          he aims at you.)&quot; and Jyotika remarked, &quot;#Shaitaan ka bura
          saaya kabhi bata kar nahin aata. (The devil comes unannounced).&quot;

          In addition to &quot;Shaitaan,&quot; Ajay Devgn is set to appear in
          Rohit Shetty’s &quot;Singham Again&quot; and Amit Sharma’s
