          The intense trailer for actor Dhanush&apos;s upcoming film Captain
          Miller was unveiled Saturday, offering a glimpse into the movie&apos;s
          action-packed narrative. Dhanush portrays a violent character fiercely
          determined to battle British forces in the film.

          The nearly 3-minute trailer is filled with gunshots, swordfights,
          explosions and other high-octane sequences, previewing the
          movie&apos;s frenetic action. Dhanush appears to be defending his
          village and its mines against the British troops. Towards the end,
          it&apos;s revealed he was formerly a British soldier himself who held
          the rank of Captain Miller.

          The Central Board of Film Certification in India recently instructed
          the makers of Captain Miller to reduce violence in final scenes by 40%
          and mute derogatory language toward the British, including words like
          &quot;white dogs.&quot; The board also asked for adjustments to bloody
          visuals.
        </p>

          Directed by Arun Matheshwaran, the film stars Dhanush along with
          Priyanka Arul Mohan, Shivaraj Kumar, Nivedita Sathish, Vinayakan and
          Sandeep Kishan. Captain Miller has received a U/A certificate and is
          slated for release on January 12.
