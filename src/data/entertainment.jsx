          The highly anticipated action film &apos;Fighter&apos; starring
          Deepika Padukone and Hrithik Roshan is generating immense buzz ahead
          of its release on January 25th. The film about Indian Air Force pilots
          has already recorded massive advance bookings of 86,516 tickets worth
          ₹2.84 crores for day one, as per industry tracker Sacnilk.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The bookings comprise 33,624 tickets for 2D Hindi, 46,790 for 3D,
          4,881 for IMAX 3D, and 1,221 for 4DX 3D. Major contribution has come
          from Delhi (₹67.39 lakhs), Maharashtra (₹75.02 lakhs), Telangana
          (₹40.73 lakhs) and Karnataka (₹43.54 lakhs).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Fighter&apos; is said to be inspired by the 2019 Pulwama attack
          and India&apos;s response. The 2 hour 46 minute film has received a
          U/A certificate from CBFC.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the synopsis, it revolves around an elite IAF unit called
          Air Dragons created to tackle militancy in Srinagar. Comprising the
          best combat aviators, they are the first responders against hostile
          activity. The story shows their struggles in balancing duty and
          personal lives while serving the nation.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by Siddharth Anand, &apos;Fighter&apos; stars Hrithik Roshan,
          Deepika Padukone and Anil Kapoor in lead roles, supported by Karan
          Singh Grover, Akshay Oberoi and Talat Aziz. Centered on the lives of
          IAF officers, the film releases on January 25th.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The incredible advance booking numbers testify to the star power of
          Hrithik-Deepika and the hype around their first film together. Their
          sizzling on-screen chemistry has fans thrilled.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the patriotic and action-packed storyline has struck a chord
          after the success of &apos;Uri: The Surgical Strike&apos; recently.
          &apos;Fighter&apos; seems poised to provide a realistic glimpse into
          the exploits of our brave air force pilots.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          With zero competition at the box office currently, the film is
          expected to take off to a flying start. The Republic Day weekend will
          give it an extended opening of almost 5 days. If the content lives up
          to expectations, &apos;Fighter&apos; could be the first blockbuster of
          2023.

          with the idol installation, open to the public after PM Modi&apos;s
          rituals. The temple complex spans 70 acres.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The temple trust has invited over 7,000 people including politicians,
          celebrities, cricketers, industrialists and more. Rajinikanth,
          Dhanush, Kangana Ranaut, Shefali Shah, Anupam Kher and others have

          Hindu community after decades of struggle.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The grand temple is seen as a testament to their unwavering faith and
          perseverance. While opinions may differ on the temple from a legal and

          cannot be denied.{" "}

          The presence of top movie stars also underlines how deeply Lord Ram

          of millions of devotees across India and worldwide.

          The Sankranti 2023 box office results have surprised the Telugu film
          industry. The festival period usually sees a clash between big star
          releases vying for audience attention. This year, all eyes were on
          Mahesh Babu&apos;s &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, his collaboration with
          hitmaker Trivikram Srinivas after &apos;Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo&apos;.
          But a relatively smaller film, &apos;HanuMan&apos; starring Teja
          Sajja, has emerged as the unlikely winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos; saw an upswing over the weekend but
          continued lagging behind &apos;HanuMan&apos;. On Day 9, it collected
          ₹3.25 crores domestically. Despite a jump in footfalls on Day 10, the
          film could only manage ₹3.50 crores. Its total now stands at ₹118
          crores. In contrast, &apos;HanuMan&apos; earned ₹14.6 crores on Day 9
          and a huge ₹16.50 crores on Day 10. Its domestic total has crossed
          ₹130 crores, far ahead of Mahesh Babu&apos;s film.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The other Sankranti releases - Nagarjuna&apos;s &apos;Naa Saami
          Ranga&apos; and Venkatesh&apos;s &apos;Sanidhav&apos; - have collected
          ₹26 crores and ₹14 crores respectively. Clearly, the underdog
          &apos;HanuMan&apos; has won over the audience.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This outcome has surprised many since Mahesh Babu typically has a huge
          fan following. The producer of &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, Naga Vamsi,
          acknowledged issues with the film&apos;s promotion. He said late night
          1am shows sent the wrong signal for a family entertainer unlike an
          action film. Release strategies need to suit the genre, he admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics have pointed to the film&apos;s predictable storyline and lack
          of freshness as reasons for the lukewarm response.
          &apos;HanuMan&apos;, in contrast, garnered praise for its novel
          superhero premise and CGI effects. Word-of-mouth has been a key factor
          in its rise.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sankranti battle shows the power of content over star power. For
          veteran stars like Mahesh Babu, their brand value can drive openings
          but the film needs to offer more. Underdog films can triumph with
          unique and compelling stories. Perhaps Telugu cinema is maturing
          towards scripts mattering as much as scales and stars.

          slow start at the box office despite the lead actor&apos;s popularity.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The film earned only Rs 1.15 crore on its opening day, Friday. But it
          picked up pace over the weekend, collecting Rs 2.1 crore on Saturday
          and an estimated Rs 2.40 crore on Sunday. This takes its total
          domestic box office earnings so far to around Rs 5.65 crore. The film
          recorded a 15.81% Hindi occupancy on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by National Award winner Ravi Jadhav, &apos;Main Atal
          Hoon&apos; is co-written by Jadhav and Rishi Virmani. The cast
          includes Pankaj Tripathi in the lead along with Piyush Mishra, Raja
          Rameshkumar Sevak, Daya Shankar Pandey, Payal Nair, Paula McGlynn and
          Gauri Sukhtankar.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite Pankaj Tripathi&apos;s strong performance, the film has
          received mixed reviews from critics so far. Film critic Shubhra Gupta
          of Indian Express gave it 2 stars. She praised Tripathi as &quot;born
          to play this part&quot; with his command over Hindi and speech rhythms
          being &quot;so hypnotic.&quot;{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she felt even an actor of Tripathi&apos;s caliber could not
          do much with such a reductive script. She remarked that instead of a
          rounded portrait, what we get is a narrative of Vajpayee as a budding
          politician who shaped the Jan Sangh, Janata Party and the current BJP.
        </p>
        <p>
          More positive reviews highlighted Tripathi&apos;s brilliant mimicry
          and how he compellingly captured Vajpayee&apos;s mannerisms. But many
          agreed the script tended to hero-worship Vajpayee rather than
          critically analyze his lengthy political journey.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The mixed response indicates that while Indian audiences are eager for
          more political biopics, there is also greater demand now for nuanced
          storytelling rather than hagiographies. For &apos;Main Atal Hoon&apos;
          to pick up pace at the box office, it may need strong word of mouth
          based on Tripathi&apos;s performance.

          Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has recently disclosed how a stunt accident on
          the sets of his 2013 Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chennai Express brought
          back traumatic memories of a fatal mishap under his late father MB
          Shetty&apos;s supervision in the 1980 film Bombay 405 Miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Bombay 405 Miles, featuring Shatrughan Sinha, MB Shetty was the
          action director. Sinha&apos;s body double Mansoor had to jump from a
          warehouse as part of a stunt sequence involving a huge blast.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview, Rohit Shetty recounted how during the shoot, due to
          chaos and confusion, the blast operator and camera operator had
          inadvertently switched positions unbeknownst to Shetty. So when
          Mansoor jumped, Shetty signaled the blast technician assuming he was
          the cameraman. The warehouse exploded with Mansoor inside, leading to
          his demise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty was a child then and only heard about the horrific accident in
          the evening. A year later, his father passed away as well, overcome by
          guilt over the incident. Though MB Shetty had a strong reputation
          among industry folks, this tragedy weighed heavily on him. He turned
          to alcoholism, withdrew from work and remained homebound before his
          death. The family understood his suffering led to his premature demise
          – destiny&apos;s cruelty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty then described a controlled car blast scene in Chennai Express.
          Though his team removes fuel tanks for such stunts, some petrol had
          spilled on the chassis while prepping. Unbeknownst to them, the
          imported car had a reserve tank. After filming the scene, a spark
          reignited the splattered petrol, engulfing the car in flames with
          veteran stuntman Shankar Anna inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          They panicked as the flaming, overturned car trapped Shankar inside.
          Fortunately fire brigades on standby doused the flames, broke the
          glass and rescued him with minor burns. The chilling parallel to his
          father&apos;s long-ago accident shook Shetty deeply before he gathered
          himself and rushed Shankar to the hospital. He has fully recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interview, Shetty called his mother Ratna a &quot;fighter&quot;
          who raised him and his sister through immense hardship after his
          father&apos;s death. Despite struggles and poverty, she shielded them
          from sadness and nurtured a stoic work ethic. To support the family,
          she resumed stunt doubling for stars, having met MB Shetty through
          this work. If you notice the top-angle shots in Andaaz song Zindagi Ek
          Safar, Ratna is the one sitting there!
        </p>
        <p>
          After Shetty started working, Ratna stopped and their fortunes
          changed. But he inherited her grit to face challenges head-on. Shetty
          feels that as long as there is work, there is hope. He remains
          eternally grateful to his mother for shielding him throughout the
          decade-long adversity after his father&apos;s passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The director has now made his streaming debut with the Prime Video
          series Indian Police Force starring Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi
          and Shilpa Shetty.

          Arabia, where he presented the Lifetime Achievement Award to veteran
          Egyptian actor Essad Youniss. A video of Salman meeting Hollywood
          legend Anthony Hopkins at the event has gone viral on social media.

          Dressed sharply in a lavender shirt and violet-grey suit, Salman
          exuded charm in the video. He is seen posing with Hopkins, known for
          films like The Silence of the Lambs and The Father.

          With his first foray into the OTT space, filmmaker Rohit Shetty brings
          his signature crash-bang formulaic cop drama to the streaming universe
          with &apos;Indian Police Force&apos;. Teaming up with co-director
          Sushwanth Prakash, Shetty packs the 7-episode show with the
          over-the-top tropes and tactics seen in his box office hit franchises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans of the director&apos;s &apos;Singham&apos; and &apos;Simmba&apos;
          films won&apos;t find surprises here. The series stays squarely in
          Shetty&apos;s wheelhouse, cramming in evil Muslim terrorists countered
          by valiant Muslim officers, contrived plots threatening innocents, and
          vehicles spinning wildly through the air. Romantic song interludes
          between the lead pair stretch the runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          References to his previous cop heroes Singham and Simmba reinforce
          we&apos;re in familiar territory, transplanted to Delhi though largely
          realized through obvious CGI landmarks. It&apos;s a greatest hits of
          elements from Shetty&apos;s cinematic cop sagas, now extended into an
          episodic streaming iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his heavy-hitter lead stars Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn and Ranveer
          Singh unavailable, Shetty casts Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi and
          Shilpa Shetty as the khaki-clad officers. They sport the mandatory
          sculpted midriffs and tough guy Ray-Ban glares synonymous with the
          director&apos;s testosterone-fueled style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vivek Oberoi is compelling but underutilized as the washed-up
          inspector reinstated for one last case. Sidharth Malhotra&apos;s
          wide-eyed sincerity sits oddly with the brute force his character
          employs. But Shilpa Shetty seems to relish playing the badass officer
          known simply by her surname, getting in on the kicking and punching
          action. Here&apos;s hoping she sees more of that in a likely second
          season.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the freedom of streaming, Shetty delivers his signature bells and
          whistles without the price of a theater ticket. Logic, nuance and
          detail are beside the point in this turbo-charged spectacle. The
          director&apos;s steadfast formula marches on, now reaching fans&apos;
          screens at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; relies on familiar devices like
          misdirection and sleight of hand rather than air-tight plotting to
          propel its thin story. The cast is decorative, tasked with modeling
          police apparel and dodging explosions rather than embodying
          characters. Fans seeking high-octane stunts and mindless entertainment
          will get their fill.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those expecting evolution or innovation in Shetty&apos;s
          storytelling may be disappointed. The show brings his high-decibel cop
          anthems to OTT largely unchanged. For devotees of the director&apos;s
          campy maximalism, it&apos;s a familiar fast food fix now delivered via
          streaming. With a captive audience at home, seasoning is optional when
          serving more of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The debut season amounts to an all-you-can-eat Rohit Shetty cop drama
          buffet. Logical restraint and nuance won&apos;t be on the menu. But
          stunts will be super-sized along with the pyrotechnics. So viewers
          craving adventures in Shetty&apos;s OTT universe can have their
          expectations met by this platter of the director&apos;s greatest hits.
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; offers a tried and tested sensory
          overload feast for fans seeking familiar flavor.
