          Despite receiving positive reviews upon its release, Ajay Devgn&apos;s
          &quot;Maidaan&quot; struggled to make an impact at the box office. The
          film, based on the life of Syed Abdul Rahim, the visionary behind
          modern Indian football, only garnered Rs 2.75 crore on Friday,
          totaling Rs 9.85 crore in domestic collections according to industry
          tracker Sacnilk. With an overall 8.8 percent occupancy in Hindi, the
          film saw higher attendance during evening screenings, particularly in
          Mumbai with an 11.33 percent occupancy across 605 shows. However, in
          Delhi and NCR, where the film had 753 screenings, the occupancy was
          merely 7.3 percent. In an attempt to boost ticket sales, the makers
          introduced a buy one get one offer for the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Maidaan&quot; faces stiff competition from Akshay Kumar and
          Tiger Shroff&apos;s &quot;Bade Miyan Chote Miyan,&quot; which is
          currently outperforming Devgn&apos;s film. The performance of both
          movies over the extended weekend remains to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devgn enjoyed success earlier in 2024 with &quot;Shaitaan,&quot;
          co-starring R Madhavan and Jyothika, which grossed Rs 147.74 crore
          domestically, making it the second highest earner of the year after
          &quot;Fighter&quot; starring Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone.
          Despite being made on a smaller budget compared to
          &quot;Maidaan,&quot; &quot;Shaitaan&quot; remains a significant
          success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, Devgn anticipates the release of the next installment
          in the &quot;Singham&quot; franchise, titled &quot;Singham
          Again,&quot; directed by Rohit Shetty. Described as the &apos;Avengers
          of the Rohit Shetty Copverse,&apos; the film boasts a star-studded
          cast including Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar, Tiger
          Shroff, Arjun Kapoor, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to Devgn, &quot;Maidaan&quot; features Priyamani and
          Gajraj Rao in key roles.

          Vidya Balan recently participated in the inaugural session of The
          Indian Express’ Expresso in Mumbai. In a candid discussion, she delved
          into her past relationships, marriage, and early career experiences.
          Notably, she shared insights into the challenges she faced from male
          actors regarding sharing the screen space, attributing it to her
          successful films like &quot;Ishqiya&quot; and &quot;The Dirty
          Picture.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on male actors&apos; reluctance to star in female-led
          films, Vidya remarked, &quot;Even today, I doubt they&apos;d be
          willing to co-star in a Vidya Balan or any female-centric film.
          It&apos;s their loss because we&apos;re producing superior quality
          films. They tend to stick to formulaic content, whereas women-led
          films offer more excitement.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          She further commented on the discomfort male stars harbor towards
          women taking the spotlight, stating, &quot;It&apos;s evident
          they&apos;re uneasy with anyone stealing the limelight. However, I
          never took offense. If they feel threatened, there&apos;s little I can
          do about it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Joining Vidya Balan was her &quot;Do Aur Do&quot; co-star Pratik
          Gandhi. The Indian Express, in collaboration with HSBC and Taj Hotels,
          initiated The Indian Express Expresso to curate diverse, intimate,
          intelligent, and entertaining content featuring personalities from the
          realms of art, culture, and entertainment.

          Actress Kriti Sanon, known for her recent roles in &quot;Crew&quot;
          and &quot;Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,&quot; emphasized the
          importance of genuine support within the film industry. Rather than
          superficial compliments, she advocated for sincere encouragement and
          solidarity among colleagues. In a conversation with Zoom TV, Kriti
          expressed her belief that true unity and support would foster a more
          positive and successful environment. She noted a gradual shift in
          attitudes but highlighted the need for authentic camaraderie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kriti underscored the significance of acknowledging and praising
          impactful work, stating that such validation is crucial for actors.
          Addressing the prevalent sexist narrative attributing a film&apos;s
          failure to its female lead, she rejected the notion that success or
          failure rests solely on one individual. Dismissing hurtful comments,
          Kriti emphasized the collaborative nature of filmmaking, asserting
          that her focus remains on her craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the film industry, Kriti acknowledged similar sexist narratives
          in sports, where women are often unfairly blamed for failures. Despite
          facing online criticism, she advocated for resilience and urged
          against giving undue attention to trolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, Kriti disclosed her involvement in the upcoming project
          &quot;Do Patti,&quot; alongside Kajol, showcasing her ongoing
          commitment to her craft.

          Renowned actor Ranjeet, celebrated for his portrayal of antagonists in
          films, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s, recently disclosed in
          an interview that despite often portraying characters depicted as
          drinkers and smokers on screen, he has never consumed alcohol in his
          life. Despite his abstinent lifestyle, Ranjeet revealed that he
          frequently hosted gatherings for his colleagues in the film industry,
          showcasing his hospitality and social nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking with ANI, Ranjeet shared insights into the vibrant social
          scene at his residence in Juhu, where industry luminaries would
          convene regularly. He emphasized that his home became a hub for both
          male and female actors, fostering a relaxed and welcoming ambiance.
          Various stars, including Reena Roy, Parveen Babi, Moushumi Chatterjee,
          and Neetu Kapoor, contributed to the festivities by preparing dishes
          ranging from paranthas to fish and bhindi.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Ranjeet, the gatherings attracted a plethora of renowned
          personalities, with the likes of Sunil Dutt, Raaj Kumar, Sanjay Khan,
          Feroz Khan, Dharmendra, and Shatrughan Sinha frequenting his abode.
          Ranjeet recalled Rajesh Khanna&apos;s penchant for consuming one to
          two bottles of alcohol during these gatherings, illustrating the
          conviviality of the era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his busy schedule, Ranjeet made it a point to accommodate his
          guests, recognizing the blessings associated with hosting visitors. He
          credited his spacious residence and ample staff for facilitating these
          gatherings, which often lasted well into the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the practicalities of such indulgent gatherings, Ranjeet
          explained that many actors, including the leading stars, would
          commence their workday later due to the late-night revelries. This
          delayed start allowed them to recuperate from the previous
          night&apos;s festivities before embarking on their professional
          commitments, a practice that Ranjeet himself adapted to maintain
          productivity amidst his hectic filming schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ranjeet&apos;s illustrious career includes memorable performances in
          iconic films such as &quot;Dharmatama,&quot; &quot;Namak Halaal,&quot;
          &quot;Sharaabi,&quot; and &quot;Lawaris,&quot; among numerous others.
          His recent revelations provide a fascinating glimpse into the social
          dynamics and lifestyle of Bollywood during its golden era.

        <p>
          In this poignant cinematic exploration, the central theme revolves
          around the interplay of love and pain. The narrative delves into the
          life of Adam (portrayed by Scott), a middle-aged man grappling with
          childhood loss, coinciding with the arrival of an unexpected
          connection that transcends conventional relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam&apos;s identity as a gay man adds a nuanced layer to his yearning
          for a family that eluded him in his formative years. Drawing
          inspiration from a loosely based novel centered on a divorced man and
          his neighbor forging a friendship, the film captures the essence of
          human connection amid the solitude of a modern metropolis,
          specifically set in London.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative unfolds within the confines of a desolate high-rise,
          symbolizing the emotional isolation of its inhabitants. Adam&apos;s
          sole companion in this urban solitude is Harry (played by Mescal), an
          individual perpetually in a state of mild intoxication. Their paths
          intertwine one night when a false fire alarm leads Harry to
          Adam&apos;s doorstep, initiating an unexpected camaraderie sealed with
          a handshake that subtly acknowledges their shared identity as queer
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amidst Adam&apos;s struggle to pen an autobiographical script, a box
          of childhood photographs prompts a journey back to his London suburban
          home. To his astonishment, he encounters his parents, portrayed by
          Bell and Foy, alive and well at the age when they passed away, leaving
          Adam at the tender age of 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ensuing dialogues, tender and sincere, explore the dynamics
          between parent and child, unveiling concealed aspects of their
          relationships. Foy skillfully portrays Adam&apos;s mother, expressing
          both surprise and innocence as she grapples with the contemporary
          understanding of her son&apos;s sexuality. The father, played with
          depth, admits his suspicions about Adam&apos;s orientation but
          confesses to avoiding the topic for the sake of comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          A poignant moment arises when Adam revisits the night etched in his
          memory as the last night spent with his parents. His adult self,
          symbolically placed between them in bed, shares dreams of a life that
          could have been—a family trip to Disneyland, constant rain, and the
          inevitable familial disagreements. The scene encapsulates the essence
          of missed opportunities and unspoken sentiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the trio decorates a Christmas tree, the song &apos;You Were Always
          on My Mind&apos; serves as a backdrop, emphasizing the subtle, often
          overlooked aspects of familial bonds. Despite their shortcomings in
