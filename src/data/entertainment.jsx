          Saying that 2023 was the year of Shah Rukh Khan wouldn&apos;t be
          incorrect. After a four-year hiatus, the Bollywood superstar returned
          to the big screen as the protagonist of Pathaan. Though lengthy, the
          wait was well worth it. Shah Rukh shed his romantic persona and put on
          the armor of an action hero. And what a hero he turned into! Both
          audiences and critics were impressed by his new avatar. For the
          five-day long weekend, fans flocked to theaters as early as 5 a.m. to
          see the opening performance of Pathaan, which also starred Deepika
          Padukone and John Abraham. The subsequent shows were completely
          booked.

          Pathaan achieved a record-breaking opening weekend collection as a
          result. Pathaan had an opening box office collection of Rs 280.75 cr,
          according to Bollywood Hungama. With a staggering lifetime collection
          of Rs 543.05 cr in India and Rs 1050.3 cr worldwide, the movie—which
          also happened to be a landmark picture for Yash Raj Films—set a new
          record for box office receipts of Rs 1000 crore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The release was significant for Bollywood overall as well as for Shah
          Rukh&apos;s career. With the release of the Covid-19 lockdown, the
          superstar broke the negative trend and brought back Bollywood at the
          box office. Distributors and producers gained confidence from Pathaan
          to release high-budget movies, and many of them did well at the box
          office. While a number of films, including Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem
          Kahaani, OMG 2, Gadar 2, and Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, maintained the
          momentum at the box office, Shah Rukh made a triumphant comeback with
          Jawan, raising the stakes even further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah Rukh not only returned to the action role in his first movie with
          Atlee, but he also played two roles. SRK shed all of his inhibitions
          and transformed into the bulky hero we had all been waiting to see him
          as, playing the part of an identical father and son. Rajakumari&apos;s
          rap in honor of King Khan and Anirudh Ravichander&apos;s famous
          &quot;massy massy&quot; BGM elevated the movie to new heights and
          caused a massive explosion at the Box Office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jawan grossed an incredible Rs 75 cr on its opening day and Rs 286.16
          cr over the course of its four-day opening weekend. After just over
          two months at the Indian box office, Jawan brought in a staggering Rs
          1148.32 cr worldwide and Rs 643.87 cr in India over its lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before anyone could have predicted that we would see him in December,
          Shah Rukh shocked fans on Diwali by making an appearance in Tiger 3.
          His cameo, which he shared on screen with Salman Khan once more,
          became the talk of the town right away. The Diwali &quot;mithai&quot;
          was delicious, but Rajkumar Hirani and SRK&apos;s collaboration,
          Dunki, was the real Diwali-Christmas gift.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arriving in time for the holidays, the movie deviated from Shah
          Rukh&apos;s previous films in style. He lost his superstar aura in the
          movie, becoming just another Punjabi boy. His love for the nation and
          the people in it was greater, and that resonated with the audience,
          even though his love for Taapsee Pannu was a secondary plot in the
          movie. The movie turned out to be one of Shah Rukh&apos;s many hits.
          As of the time of reporting, the movie has brought in Rs 444.44 cr at
          the global box office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shah Rukh&apos;s humility was brought to our attention by a number of
          Bollywood celebrities during the year through interviews,
          conversations, and social media posts, even though these three films
          solidified his position as the industry&apos;s most popular actor. Who
          could forget the incredibly popular selfie that Mona Singh took with
          him at his star-studded birthday party, or the fact that Vikram
          Kochhar, the star of Dunki, revealed that the superstar surprised him
          with a birthday party despite having a busy schedule during filming!
        </p>
        <p>
          Although 2023 will be remembered for a variety of reasons, Shah Rukh
          Khan&apos;s year will always be the most memorable. The actor will
          also begin 2024 on a high note as he will be featured in the 13th
          CNN-News18 Indian of the Year edition.

          Rashmika Mandanna and Vijay Deverakonda have always had a fantastic
          on-screen and off-screen chemistry. Their fans have always loved
          seeing them together, and they are about to receive some excellent
          news.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are reportedly planning to tie the knot next month, according to
          a News18 Telugu report, though this has not yet been confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans are certain that the couple is deeply in love and appears to be
          living together, even though they haven&apos;t made it official yet.
          Actor Ranbir Kapoor appears to have confirmed Vijay and
          Rashmika&apos;s romance, which has once again made headlines amid
          rumors and reports about their relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the Animal actor made his co-star blush when she answered
          a phone call from her purported boyfriend Vijay Devarakonda while they
          were promoting their upcoming movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with Rashmika Mandanna and Sandeep Reddy, Ranbir Kapoor promoted
          Animal on the popular show Unstoppable with NBK 2. The guests and the
          host struck up a lively discussion, with Vijay and Rashmika being
          teased about their romantic lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few of the show&apos;s videos, which highlight their amusing banter,
          are going viral on social media. Rashmika finally calls the actor
          after Ranbir begs her to call Vijay Deverakonda, teasing her by
          saying, &quot;He (Vijay) won&apos;t pick up Sandeep&apos;s
          phone.&quot; &quot;What&apos;s up with that?&quot; asked Vijay,
          putting a faint smile on Rashmika&apos;s countenance. She also told
          him that the phone was in speaker mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the conversation, Ranbir Kapoor made fun of the two of them,
          claiming that Balakrishnan was becoming envious of the call and
          that&apos;s why they&apos;ve been referring to her as
          &quot;Crushmika.&quot; The celebrity host questioned Vijay about his
          romantic partner, to which he replied, &quot;Bala sir loves
          Rashmika.&quot; When the Kushi actor declared, &quot;I love Sandeep
          Reddy Vanga,&quot; they were all in splits.
