          Krushna Abhishek recently shared insights into his television journey,
          shedding light on his comedic exploits and the financial compensation
          he received. During an interview on Bharti Singh&apos;s podcast,
          Bharti TV, the actor disclosed that his association with Bollywood
          star Govinda, his uncle, often attracted casting interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recounting his Comedy Circus stint, Krushna admitted, &quot;I signed
          up for Comedy Circus primarily for the monetary aspect, and I was
          content with it. They offered me ₹1.5 lakh per episode, showcasing
          considerable respect due to my connection with Govinda. The prospect
          of earning ₹3 lakh per day left me in awe.&quot;

          The conversation delved into Krushna&apos;s foray into Bhojpuri films,
          where he reminisced about earning ₹3 lakh per film during that period.
          He emphasized the intense shooting schedule, spanning 30 days of
          day-and-night shoots, reflecting on his pride in contributing to the
          Bhojpuri film industry. He shared an amusing anecdote about a film
          where he struggled to comprehend scenes, only to see it emerge as a
          box office hit.

          Looking ahead, Krushna Abhishek is set to feature in &quot;The Great
          Indian Kapil Show.&quot; Described as a variety chat show unfolding
          within the vibrant confines of an airport, the series promises weekly

          Fortnite and Jujutsu Kaisen, representing the pinnacle of their
          respective realms, have captured widespread attention in the gaming
          and anime/manga landscapes. Fortnite, with its extensive history of
          dynamic crossovers, stands as a giant in the gaming world.
          Simultaneously, Jujutsu Kaisen has carved its own niche in the anime
          and manga universe, achieving remarkable success. Recent leaks
          pertaining to Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 hint at an impending
          collaboration between these two influential entities.

          The prior collaboration between Jujutsu Kaisen and Fortnite witnessed
          the introduction of beloved characters such as Megumi, Nobara
          Kugisaki, Satoru Gojo, and Yuji Itadori in the form of in-game skins.
          This ambitious crossover resonated strongly with gamers who share a
          passion for anime, as it skillfully translated the characters&apos;
          Cursed Techniques into engaging in-game features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 on the horizon, leaks from March
          4, courtesy of reputable Fortnite insider @ShiinaBR, suggest a second
          wave of the Fortnite X Jujutsu Kaisen collaboration. This leak
          indicates Epic Games&apos; recognition of the previous
          collaboration&apos;s success and its intention to replicate that
          triumph.
        </p>
        <p>
          While official confirmation of Jujutsu Kaisen&apos;s return to
          Fortnite is yet to be announced, the leaked information unveils Epic
          Games&apos; strategic move to sustain the momentum of their
          collaborative endeavors. Currently, Fortnite enthusiasts are eagerly
          anticipating the Fortnite x Avatar: The Last Airbender crossover
          scheduled for April 2024, as revealed by another credible leak.
          Consequently, the return of Jujutsu Kaisen to the Fortnite landscape
          is likely slated for a subsequent period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The release of Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 on March 8, 2024, is
          anticipated to usher in a thematic shift towards Greek mythology.
          Speculation also surrounds the potential return of the fan-favorite
          character Midas. As the gaming community braces for these
          developments, the prospect of a renewed collaboration with Jujutsu
          Kaisen adds an extra layer of excitement to Fortnite&apos;s evolving
          narrative.

          Tom Glynn-Carney, Sonoya Mizuno, Rhys Ifans, Harry Collett, Bethany

          Rankin, Freddie Fox, and Simon Russell Beale.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first season, consisting of 10 episodes, aired from August 21 to
          Oct. 23, 2022. Its success was evident as HBO swiftly renewed House of
          the Dragon for a second season just one week after the series
          premiere, which garnered record-breaking ratings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In anticipation of the upcoming season, critics have provided
          insights. The Hindustan Times review of the first episode commented on
          the series&apos; explicit content, highlighting scenes of violence,
          pain, suffering, and torture reminiscent of Game of Thrones. The
          review suggested that the prequel may have drawn the wrong lessons
          from its predecessor, showcasing voyeuristic scenes and graphic
          depictions that, while effective in the past, may now face scrutiny in
          light of evolving preferences for more nuanced storytelling within the
          genres of women&apos;s suffering, succession drama, and epic fantasy.

          Ivanka Trump&apos;s Instagram post featured a picture of herself
          standing in front of a lavishly decorated elephant at the

          took to her Instagram Stories to condemn the treatment of animals in
          such festivities. She shared the image, stating, &quot;I&apos;m
          appalled at this picture of the Ambani celebration. I don&apos;t think
          this should happen to any animal, especially not to animals that are
          being rescued and rehabilitated. Heartbreaking, just heartbreaking

          The festivities spanned three days, commencing with &apos;An Evening
          in Everland,&apos; where guests donned elegant cocktail attire. The

          Actor Manisha Rani clinched the title of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 11 winner
          on Saturday night, securing the prize of Rs 30 lakh and a trip to Yas
          Islands, Abu Dhabi. She made her entry into the show as a wild card

          &quot;I feel very happy. I still cannot believe that the trophy is in
          my hand. It is like a dream come true.&quot; Addressing the uncommon
          achievement of a wild card contestant winning the show, she remarked,
          &quot;Earlier I used to think that since I came in as a wild card, I
          might not win. People are skeptical about coming as wild cards because
          90 per cent of the time they don’t win as they don’t get the time to
          prove themselves. By the time we join the show, half the season has
          passed, and people have made their mark already. But if in little time
          you can do what others were not able to do from the start, then you
          can win. Hard work is the key. I experimented with various dance forms
          in my journey, and I got very little time to prove myself, but I am
          glad I did.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Manisha revealed grappling with moments of self-doubt during her
          journey on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, admitting, &quot;I have thought of
          giving up many times on this Jhalak journey, I felt I couldn’t do it,
          but then that hunger to win the trophy kept me going.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Eyeing a career in Bollywood, Manisha aims to enhance her skills and
          delve into acting. She disclosed her top three actors she wishes to
          collaborate with, stating, &quot;I have always wanted to work with
          Salman Khan and Kartik Aaryan. Shahid Kapoor is my favorite actor. So

          While some entrepreneurs have found success through Shark Tank India,
          others have left empty-handed. Among them is Recode, a cosmetics brand
          that gained significant attention on the show, leading to a
          substantial increase in its valuation. Co-founders Rahul and Dheeraj
          appeared on the show&apos;s second season seeking Rs 1 crore in
          funding for 1% equity, valuing the company at Rs 100 crore.

          The sharks were surprised by the valuation and the company&apos;s
          revenue, which reached Rs 15 crore in the previous financial year.
          Additionally, the founders disclosed their unconventional marketing
          strategy of offering free grooming lessons and lunch to college girls.

          Aman Gupta and Namita Thapar withdrew from the deal due to personal
          connections with competitors, while Peyush Bansal expressed concerns
          about branding. Anupam Mittal acknowledged the founders&apos;
          impressive organic reach but declined to invest, leaving Recode with
          publicity but no deal.

          The company&apos;s Brand Development Head, Ishani Trehan, highlighted
          Shark Tank&apos;s impact, noting the limited focus on financials
          during discussions. Despite the rejection, the publicity from the show
          significantly boosted Recode&apos;s brand awareness.

          According to India Today, Recode&apos;s valuation has soared to Rs 240
          crore, Rs 140 crore higher than the Shark Tank estimate. The show
          continues to air its third season.
