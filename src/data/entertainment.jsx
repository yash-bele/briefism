          Thalapathy Vijay&apos;s eagerly awaited film &quot;The Greatest of All
          Time&quot; (The GOAT) has been generating buzz since its release date
          was confirmed for September 5, coinciding with the Vinayaka Chaturthi
          weekend. Notably, it marks Vijay&apos;s second-to-last film before his
          full-fledged entry into politics. Amplifying the anticipation, the
          filmmakers unveiled the much-anticipated first single track,
          &quot;Whistle Podu,&quot; on Sunday, coinciding with the Tamil New
          Year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lyrical video, inspired by the renowned mantra of the Chennai
          Super Kings (CSK) team, boasts musical composition by Yuvan Shankar
          Raja and choreography by Raju Sundaram. The video showcases Vijay
          alongside Prabhudeva, Prashanth, and Ajmal Ameer, dancing in sync.
        </p>
        <p>
          Running for 5 minutes, the video also pays homage to director Venkat
          Prabhu&apos;s past works, notably &quot;Mankatha,&quot; starring
          Ajith. Furthermore, viewers are treated to behind-the-scenes glimpses
          of the song&apos;s creation. The upbeat track features Vijay,
          Prashanth, and Prabhudeva showcasing their dance prowess to
          Yuvan&apos;s vibrant music.
        </p>
        <p>
          This track, celebrating camaraderie, adds to the mounting excitement
          for the film. &quot;GOAT&quot; is rumored to delve into time travel,
          with Vijay portraying a dual role, drawing comparisons to the
          Hollywood film &quot;Looper.&quot; However, these speculations await
          official confirmation.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over 80% of filming already completed in Russia, the movie boasts
          a star-studded cast including Meenakshi Chaudhary, Prabhudeva,
          Prashanth, Sneha, Laila, Jayaram, Mohan, Vaibhav, and Premgi Amaren in
          pivotal roles. &quot;GOAT&quot; is set for release in Tamil, Telugu,
          and Hindi languages.

          Kannada film producer and entrepreneur Soundarya Jagadish passed away
          after an alleged suicide attempt, as confirmed by both the police and
          close sources on Sunday. The incident reportedly occurred at his
          residence in Mahalakshmi Layout, Bengaluru, earlier in the day.
          Authorities stated that investigations are ongoing, and proper
          procedures will be followed.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Jagadish has passed away after attempting suicide. He was
          brought to the hospital where he was declared deceased. Further
          inquiries are being conducted to ascertain the cause. There were no
          prior health issues, and the sudden nature of this event is
          perplexing,&quot; stated Jagadish&apos;s friend, Shreyas, to
          reporters.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about a recent bank notice served to Jagadish and whether
          it could have contributed to the incident, Shreyas clarified,
          &quot;No, there is no connection. The bank issue has been ongoing for
          some time now. Business matters are separate.&quot; He emphasized that
          the police were alerted promptly, refuting any &quot;misleading
          reports&quot; suggesting cardiac arrest as the cause of death. Shreyas
          explained, &quot;Upon discovery, he was immediately rushed to the
          hospital this morning... he had attempted suicide by hanging.&quot;
          Jagadish, who also owned a pub in the city, was involved in various
          business ventures alongside his role as a film producer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent reports indicated that Jagadish&apos;s pub had been embroiled
          in controversy due to late-night partying by certain film
          personalities and crew members, leading to a temporary suspension of
          its license.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout his career, Jagadish had produced several films, including
          &quot;Snehitaru,&quot; &quot;Appu Pappu,&quot; &quot;Mast Maja
          Maadi,&quot; and &quot;Ramleela.&quot;

          Despite receiving positive reviews upon its release, Ajay Devgn&apos;s
          &quot;Maidaan&quot; struggled to make an impact at the box office. The
          film, based on the life of Syed Abdul Rahim, the visionary behind
          modern Indian football, only garnered Rs 2.75 crore on Friday,
          totaling Rs 9.85 crore in domestic collections according to industry
          tracker Sacnilk. With an overall 8.8 percent occupancy in Hindi, the
          film saw higher attendance during evening screenings, particularly in
          Mumbai with an 11.33 percent occupancy across 605 shows. However, in
          Delhi and NCR, where the film had 753 screenings, the occupancy was
          merely 7.3 percent. In an attempt to boost ticket sales, the makers
          introduced a buy one get one offer for the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Maidaan&quot; faces stiff competition from Akshay Kumar and
          Tiger Shroff&apos;s &quot;Bade Miyan Chote Miyan,&quot; which is
          currently outperforming Devgn&apos;s film. The performance of both
          movies over the extended weekend remains to be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Devgn enjoyed success earlier in 2024 with &quot;Shaitaan,&quot;
          co-starring R Madhavan and Jyothika, which grossed Rs 147.74 crore
          domestically, making it the second highest earner of the year after
          &quot;Fighter&quot; starring Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone.
          Despite being made on a smaller budget compared to
          &quot;Maidaan,&quot; &quot;Shaitaan&quot; remains a significant
          success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, Devgn anticipates the release of the next installment
          in the &quot;Singham&quot; franchise, titled &quot;Singham
          Again,&quot; directed by Rohit Shetty. Described as the &apos;Avengers
          of the Rohit Shetty Copverse,&apos; the film boasts a star-studded
          cast including Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar, Tiger
          Shroff, Arjun Kapoor, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to Devgn, &quot;Maidaan&quot; features Priyamani and
          Gajraj Rao in key roles.

          Vidya Balan recently participated in the inaugural session of The
          Indian Express’ Expresso in Mumbai. In a candid discussion, she delved
          into her past relationships, marriage, and early career experiences.
          Notably, she shared insights into the challenges she faced from male
          actors regarding sharing the screen space, attributing it to her
          successful films like &quot;Ishqiya&quot; and &quot;The Dirty
          Picture.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on male actors&apos; reluctance to star in female-led
          films, Vidya remarked, &quot;Even today, I doubt they&apos;d be
          willing to co-star in a Vidya Balan or any female-centric film.
          It&apos;s their loss because we&apos;re producing superior quality
          films. They tend to stick to formulaic content, whereas women-led
          films offer more excitement.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          She further commented on the discomfort male stars harbor towards
          women taking the spotlight, stating, &quot;It&apos;s evident
          they&apos;re uneasy with anyone stealing the limelight. However, I
          never took offense. If they feel threatened, there&apos;s little I can
          do about it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Joining Vidya Balan was her &quot;Do Aur Do&quot; co-star Pratik
          Gandhi. The Indian Express, in collaboration with HSBC and Taj Hotels,
          initiated The Indian Express Expresso to curate diverse, intimate,
          intelligent, and entertaining content featuring personalities from the
          realms of art, culture, and entertainment.

          importance of genuine support within the film industry. Rather than

          expressed her belief that true unity and support would foster a more

          attitudes but highlighted the need for authentic camaraderie.

        <p>
          Kriti underscored the significance of acknowledging and praising
          impactful work, stating that such validation is crucial for actors.
          Addressing the prevalent sexist narrative attributing a film&apos;s
          failure to its female lead, she rejected the notion that success or
          failure rests solely on one individual. Dismissing hurtful comments,
          Kriti emphasized the collaborative nature of filmmaking, asserting
          that her focus remains on her craft.

          Beyond the film industry, Kriti acknowledged similar sexist narratives
          in sports, where women are often unfairly blamed for failures. Despite
          facing online criticism, she advocated for resilience and urged
          against giving undue attention to trolls.
