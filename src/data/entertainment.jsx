          After a hiatus spanning 13 years, Kiran Rao has made a triumphant
          return to the director&apos;s chair with &quot;Laapataa Ladies,&quot;
          her latest project following the critically acclaimed &quot;Dhobi
          Ghat.&quot; The film&apos;s trailer, jointly produced by Kiran&apos;s
          ex-husband and actor Aamir Khan along with Jyoti Deshpande, was
          unveiled on Wednesday. Leading roles in the film are portrayed by
          Pratibha Ranta, Sparsh Shrivastav, and Nitanshi Goel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set in the rural landscapes of India, &quot;Laapataa Ladies&quot;
          revolves around the captivating tale of two young brides inadvertently
          exchanged on a train. The trailer unfolds the story of Deepak Kumar,
          played by Sparsh Shrivastav, the groom on a frantic quest to find his
          real bride. Seeking assistance in his search, he encounters a police
          officer portrayed by Ravi Kishan. As the investigation progresses, the
          police officer becomes suspicious of the bride who was mistakenly
          exchanged with Deepak Kumar&apos;s wife, leading to a series of
          confusion, chaos, and moments of laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in
          September 2023, &quot;Laapataa Ladies&quot; received a standing
          ovation at the prestigious festival. Produced under the banners of
          Aamir Khan Productions and Kindling Productions, the film is based on
          an award-winning story by Biplab Goswami. The screenplay and dialogue
          have been skillfully crafted by Sneha Desai, with additional
          contributions to the dialogues by Divyanidhi Sharma. The eagerly
          anticipated movie is slated for release on March 1, 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          This collaborative venture marks the first project between Kiran Rao
          and Aamir Khan since the announcement of their separation in 2021.

          Hrithik Roshan&apos;s upcoming film &quot;Fighter&quot; has garnered
          widespread acclaim for his impressive look, revealed his trainer Kris
          Gethin. According to Gethin, Hrithik embarked on an intensive training
          regimen almost 5-6 months prior to the film&apos;s shoot, maintaining
          a demanding schedule that excluded any cheat days for several months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gethin, who has been Hrithik&apos;s trainer for over a decade,
          reminisced about the initial contact with the actor&apos;s team in
          2011. He admitted to not knowing much about Hrithik at the time but
          emphasized the special connection they formed when they met. Despite
          being 50 years old, Hrithik&apos;s physique for &quot;Fighter&quot;
          exhibited a remarkable ability to &quot;change and adapt like it did
          12-13 years ago,&quot; appearing as if his body hadn&apos;t aged.
          Gethin attributed this to Hrithik&apos;s unwavering focus on achieving
          a healthier body, emphasizing that prioritizing health naturally leads
          to aesthetic goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding Hrithik&apos;s disciplined diet, Gethin revealed that the
          actor abstains from consuming any &quot;bad food&quot; for extended
          periods. Even on cheat days, Hrithik indulges in larger portions of
          his usual &quot;clean food.&quot; Gethin recounted an incident during
          a New Year&apos;s trip to Dubai, where Hrithik retired to bed by 9:30
          pm instead of joining the festivities. The following morning, he was
          up and engaged in beach running by 6 am.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gethin also shared insights into his training sessions with Vicky
          Kaushal, describing him as a &quot;high achiever&quot; who approaches
          his work and workouts with utmost seriousness. Despite operating on
          minimal sleep due to hectic shoot schedules and workouts, Vicky&apos;s
          dedication is unwavering, and he has not complained about the
          demanding routine, according to Gethin.

          After earning acclaim for his role in Jiyen Krishnakumar&apos;s action
          thriller &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; last year, the Tamil actor Balaji
          Patturaj, more commonly known as RJ Balaji, is gearing up for his
          first release of 2024, titled &quot;Singapore Saloon.&quot; Directed
          by Gokul, this coming-of-age film features Meenakshi Chaudhary,
          Sathyaraj, and Lal in pivotal roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recently unveiled trailer provides a glimpse into the movie,
          showcasing the journey of a young man with aspirations of becoming an
          exceptional hairstylist, inspired by his grandfather&apos;s legacy.
          Described as &quot;the untold story of a barber with perseverance,
          endurance, and resilience,&quot; the film boasts special appearances
          by director Lokesh Kanagaraj and actor Jiiva.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an outsider with no industry connections prior to entering the
          cinema, Balaji adheres to a personal philosophy, treating his work as
          his calling card.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;For an outsider who has struggled to enter the industry, a
          couple of failures may end their chances. On the other hand, an
          insider can survive even after delivering ten flops in ten years and
          still have two films in hand in the eleventh year,&quot; he remarked
          during a conversation with Film Companion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on the industry dynamics, Balaji expressed his perspective.
          &quot;I watched Ananya Pandey&apos;s &apos;Kho Gaye Hum Kahan&apos; on
          Netflix. I thought she did a good job, but consider someone from
          outside getting such an opportunity after not having worked on notable
          films before. Since my radio days, I&apos;ve been taught to treat
          every segment as if it&apos;s my last. This philosophy guides my work
          on films; I give my best to secure future opportunities without having
          to ask for them,&quot; he explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussing the challenges faced by outsiders in the film industry,
          Balaji drew parallels with the unpredictable nature of politics.
          &quot;In cinema, much like in politics, they say there are no
          permanent friends. People are good to you as long as they think you
          are beneath them. Once you treat them as equals, they struggle to
          accept it. This holds true in every sphere. While I&apos;m not placing
          blame, people often find comfort in certain roles, making it
          challenging for them to accept changes in dynamics. However, I prefer
          to distance myself from those who hold such views,&quot; Balaji
          remarked.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Singapore Saloon&quot; is scheduled for release on January 25.

          Shruti Haasan is set to take the lead in &quot;Chennai Story,&quot; a
          collaborative venture between India and the UK, which was initially
          poised to feature Samantha Ruth Prabhu. According to Variety,
          Samantha&apos;s replacement by Shruti Haasan is attributed to
          undisclosed reasons, with speculation suggesting Samantha&apos;s
          withdrawal from the film due to her year-long sabbatical. The film, an
          adaptation of Timeri N. Murari&apos;s 2004 novel &quot;The
          Arrangements of Love,&quot; is directed by Philip John, a
          BFTA-nominated director renowned for his work on &quot;Downton
          Abbey.&quot; In the movie, Shruti Haasan will portray a private
          detective, and joining her in the cast is Viveik Kalra, known for
          &quot;Blinded By The Light.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Chennai Story&quot; unfolds as a coming-of-age drama centered
          around a detective in India. Although the narrative revolves around a
          Tamil detective, the film predominantly features English with numerous
          Tamil dialogues. Co-authored by Philip John and Sri Lankan
          actor-filmmaker Nimmi Harasgama, the film explores universal themes
          through the prism of an international collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expressing her enthusiasm for the project, Shruti Haasan conveyed to
          Variety the personal significance of depicting the diversity and
          uniqueness of Chennai on a global platform. Hailing from Chennai
          herself, she emphasized the excitement of collaborating with Phil and
          contributing to the storytelling of global yet culturally grounded
          narratives through international partnerships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Produced by Guru Films (India), Ripple World Pictures (UK), and Wales
          Ie Ie Productions, &quot;Chennai Story&quot; has the support of the
          British Film Institute. This project marks Shruti Haasan&apos;s
          continued foray into international cinema, following her role in the
          British psychological thriller &quot;The Eye&quot; (2023), which
          premiered at the London Independent Film Festival and the Greek
          International Film Festival.

          Bejoy Nambiar, a former assistant of renowned director Mani Ratnam,
          has consistently ventured into films catering to both Tamil and Hindi
          markets, much like his mentor. Notably, Bejoy goes beyond the
          conventional approach of dubbing and often features distinct casts for
          the Tamil and Hindi versions of his films. This approach was evident
          in his third film, &quot;David,&quot; where Vikram and Jiiva led the
          Tamil version, while the Hindi rendition starred Neil Nitin Mukesh and
          Vinay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same strategy is being applied to his upcoming project,
          &quot;Por&quot; (titled &quot;Dange&quot; in Hindi). Arjun Das and
          Kalidas Jayaram will play the lead roles in the Tamil version, while
          Harshavardhan and Ehan Bhatt will replace them in the Hindi
          adaptation. The film is set against the backdrop of a college campus,
          depicting the conflicts between two rival factions while addressing
          significant social issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the lead actors, the movie features acclaimed
          performers such as Sanjana Natarajan from &quot;Sarpatta
          Parambarai,&quot; TJ Bhanu of &quot;Vaazhl,&quot; and Nikita Dutta in
          pivotal roles. As of now, details about the film&apos;s music composer
          and release date are yet to be disclosed. The first-look posters, with
          their compelling tagline, have already generated anticipation and
          curiosity among the audience, making &quot;Por&quot; a film to watch
          out for in both Tamil and Hindi cinema circuits.

          Rick broke his silence on Instagram, posting a photo with Adam and
          writing &quot;You will always be in my heart! I love you Adam.&quot;
          The family previously said in a statement they were &quot;extremely
          saddened&quot; and asked for privacy to grieve Adam&apos;s tragic
          loss.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          His death is being investigated by Las Vegas police. While Rick&apos;s
          older son Corey was featured on Pawn Stars, Adam notably never
          appeared on the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam&apos;s passing comes as drug overdose deaths surpassed 112,000
          nationwide in 2023 for the first time ever, per reports. The spike is
          driven by the synthetic opioid fentanyl flowing into the U.S. across
          borders.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts say substantive solutions will require complex, costly and
          time-intensive healthcare reforms, expanded access to housing and
          mental health programs, and improved border security. But so far,
          promises by politicians to stop fentanyl smuggling have lacked
          actionable plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          By speaking out, Rick Harrison aims to draw attention to the
          devastating human toll of the border crisis that claimed his own
          son&apos;s life. Adam&apos;s story underscores that behind the
          statistics are real families suffering immense loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Harrison family grieves privately, Rick hopes Adam&apos;s
          overdose spurs urgency in fighting the fentanyl epidemic destroying
          lives and communities across America. His emotional plea captured both
          the heartbreak of losing a child and the anger that more hasn&apos;t
          been done to prevent such tragedies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Pawn Stars patriarch, Adam&apos;s death encapsulates the total
          failure to address border problems. By calling for real solutions,
          Rick gives voice to the experiences of too many families who have
          endured pain and loss from a crisis that keeps escalating out of
          control. His activism transforms personal tragedy into a rallying cry
          for officials to do better before more lives are senselessly lost.

          Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar was among the select few from Bollywood
          privileged to witness the historic inauguration at the Ram Mandir in
          Ayodhya on January 22nd. Speaking from Ayodhya, he described the
          incredible energy and euphoria amongst the crowds there.{" "}

        <p>
          Bhandarkar said the vibe was vibrant and the emotion of everyone
          present was on another level. He called it a remarkable moment for all
          Indians, especially when the temple doors finally opened and Ram Lalla
          was revealed. People were overwhelmed and unable to control their
          emotions, with many moved to tears according to the director.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the doors opened, Bhandarkar said the crowds erupted in chants of
          &quot;Jai Shree Ram&quot;, clapping and cheering at getting the first
          glimpse of the idol. He called the experience emotional and
          overwhelming for everyone present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 55-year-old felt honored and privileged to be among the few from
          Bollywood included in the historic event, alongside esteemed actors,
          cricketers, filmmakers and industrialists. He said witnessing the
          inauguration was a once in a lifetime moment that he couldn&apos;t
          miss for the world.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Having eagerly looked forward to it for weeks, Bhandarkar expressed
          joy at being part of the ceremony and said it was a surreal moment he
          would cherish his whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the filmmaker, the most memorable part of the event was
          when rose petals were showered by helicopters overhead. He said seeing
          Ram Lalla&apos;s inner sanctum open as everyone cried was incredible
          beyond words.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Bhandarkar couldn&apos;t meet Prime Minister Modi, he said the
          PM looked very happy, as did the entire Bollywood contingent present
          during the celebrations.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The director also shared a viral selfie with his Fashion co-star
          Kangana Ranaut, who he called a very good friend and talented actress.
          He said they talked and clicked pictures together while seated near
          each other at the ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Bhandarkar conveyed his awe at experiencing such a
          significant spiritual and cultural milestone for India first-hand. As
          one of the few Bollywood guests present, he described the inclusive
          atmosphere and shared emotional reaction that made it a once in a
          lifetime memory to cherish.
