          Veteran actor Shakti Kapoor, known for his iconic villainous and
          humorous roles in 80s and 90s films, recently recounted an amusing
          incident from the shooting of the 1982 movie Satte Pe Satta. In an
          interview with Digital Commentary, Shakti disclosed that during his
          peak in Bollywood, he was quite possessive and particular about his
          scenes and dialogues. However, this behavior made him the target of a
          prank engineered by Amitabh Bachchan and other actors on the Satte Pe
          Satta set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling somewhat insecure being one of seven actors in the film,
          Shakti Kapoor sought reassurance from director Raj N Sippy, who
          vouched he was ‘as good as Amitabh Bachchan.’ Shakti had also
          innovatively incorporated a stammer into his character&apos;s dialogue
          delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Narrating the prank played on him by Big B and co-stars, Shakti said,
          “We were shooting for the song ‘Dukki Pe Dukki Ho.’ My second dialogue
          was in the song. I was waiting for the shot when I saw Amitabh
          Bachchan saying my dialogue instead. I thought, ‘Amitabh is saying my
          dialogue. My career is over.’ I assumed as a star he could do
          anything. He took my dialogue. I went to the director and complained
          ‘this is not fair.’ All six actors were sitting behind a bush watching
          me cry and started clapping saying, ‘We’re joking with you.’ The
          camera wasn’t rolling. They thought Shakti Kapoor is so serious about
          his scenes and dialogues, let’s prank him. Amitabh then told the
          director to give me 3-4 more shots saying ‘He will die otherwise.’”
        </p>
        <p>
          Satte Pe Satta, released in 1982, is a Hindi action comedy film
          directed by Raj N Sippy and produced by Romu N Sippy. Starring Amitabh
          Bachchan, Hema Malini, Amjad Khan and others, it revolves around seven
          unsophisticated brothers who are civilized by Indu (Malini), wife of
          the eldest Ravi Anand (Bachchan). The plot takes a twist when Ravi’s
          lookalike Babu is ordered by cunning uncle Ranjit Singh (Khan) to
          murder disabled heiress Seema Singh (Ranjeeta Kaur). Adapted from
          Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), it is regarded as a Bollywood
          classic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The behind-the-scenes anecdote provides insight into Shakti
          Kapoor&apos;s dedication and insecurity as a character actor sharing
          screen space with superstar Amitabh Bachchan. It also showcases the
          playful camaraderie between co-stars on set. The prank indicates that
          Shakti was initially perceived as an overly earnest performer by his
          co-stars, who decided to pull his leg.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Amitabh ensuring additional shots for Shakti afterwards
          demonstrates his graciousness and professional courtesy towards a
          co-actor. Overall, the incident provides a humorous glimpse into the
          personalities and equations between some of Bollywood&apos;s biggest
          stars in their prime decades ago, especially the towering impact of an
          icon like Bachchan. It adds another memorable moment to the rich
          nostalgia surrounding an all-time classic like Satte Pe Satta nearly
          four decades later.

          Actor Shehnaaz Gill made heads turn in a glitzy gold bustier blouse
          paired with a shimmering black sequin saree by designer Gaurav Gupta.
          She wore the striking cocktail-perfect ensemble to Ira Khan and Nupur
          Shikhare's star-studded wedding reception in Mumbai. While other celeb
          guests opted for traditional ethnic looks, Shehnaaz's modern saree
          twist was perfect for fashion-forward Indian women. Her gold bustier
          and embellished saree made for the ultimate party outfit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz shared photos of herself dressed in the Gaurav Gupta gold top
          and black sequin saree on Instagram. "Gold & Glitter," she aptly
          captioned the post, earning praise from fans calling her a "Golden
          Diva" and "Golden Girl of India."
        </p>
        <p>
          The pre-draped saree featured dazzling gold diamantes embellishing the
          entire front, a ruffled pallu split into three floor-sweeping trains,
          ruffled pleats, ankle-grazing hem, and a figure-hugging cinched
          silhouette. She paired it with a gold bustier blouse having broad
          straps, shimmery beaded work, fitted bodice, plunging sweetheart
          neckline with front slit, and a curved super-cropped hem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping accessories minimal, Shehnaaz wore just a dainty gold bracelet
          and heels. Her glam picks included winged black eyeliner, golden eye
          shadow, feathered brows, glossy caramel lips, blushed cheeks, and
          highlighted contours. Flowing center-parted locks styled in
          well-defined curls completed her party-perfect look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz was last seen in the 2022 film Thank You For Coming, starring
          alongside Bhumi Pednekar, Dolly Singh, Kusha Kapila and Shibani Bedi.
          The movie also premiered at the 46th Toronto International Film
          Festival (TIFF) in 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor frequently makes best-dressed lists for her experimental
          fashion choices spanning ethnic, fusion, casual and glamorous looks.
          Be it sarees, lehengas, gowns or corset designs, Shehnaaz carries both
          Indian and Western ensembles with flair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gold and black sequin Gaurav Gupta number gave a glitzy upgrade to
          the traditional saree. The sensual bustier styling with a saree draped
          around the waist created an alluring Indo-Western vibe. The
          embellished fabric, sultry palette and figure-hugging silhouette made
          it perfect for cocktail nights or receptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shehnaaz proved sequins can work beautifully for evening ethnic wear,
          beyond just plain silks or chiffons. Her outfit gave inspiration for
          modern Indian women who want to give the saree a sexy twist. The
          plunging neckline, strappy sleeves, sequin work and cropped pallu gave
          traditional drapes a contemporary makeover.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actor showed how fusion pairings like the bustier-saree can add
          drama and oomph for wedding functions and parties. While the black and
          gold color scheme lent a classical elegance, the shimmery
          embellishments and sensual styling gave it a glamorous edge.
          Shehnaaz's red carpet-worthy ensemble exemplified her experimental and
          confident sense of style.
