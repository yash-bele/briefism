          After several contentious years of criticism and a boycott of the
          Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presented the awards
          previously, the Golden Globes are back this year under new ownership.
          The production company that has created and aired the show for many
          years now owns the Globes. This year&apos;s Golden Globes, which are
          hosted by comedian Jo Koy, feature two new categories: Best
          Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on TV and Cinematic and Box Office
          Achievement.
