          Rick Harrison, star of the hit show Pawn Stars, spoke out against the
          border crisis after it was revealed his son Adam Harrison died from a
          fentanyl overdose at age 39.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Yes, I can confirm Adam died from a fentanyl overdose,&quot; the
          58-year-old Rick told the New York Post. &quot;The fentanyl crisis in
          this country must be taken more seriously. It seems it is just flowing
          over the borders and nothing is being done about it. We must do
          better.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Rick broke his silence on Instagram, posting a photo with Adam and
          writing &quot;You will always be in my heart! I love you Adam.&quot;
          The family previously said in a statement they were &quot;extremely
          saddened&quot; and asked for privacy to grieve Adam&apos;s tragic
          loss.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          His death is being investigated by Las Vegas police. While Rick&apos;s
          older son Corey was featured on Pawn Stars, Adam notably never
          appeared on the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam&apos;s passing comes as drug overdose deaths surpassed 112,000
          nationwide in 2023 for the first time ever, per reports. The spike is
          driven by the synthetic opioid fentanyl flowing into the U.S. across
          borders.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Experts say substantive solutions will require complex, costly and
          time-intensive healthcare reforms, expanded access to housing and
          mental health programs, and improved border security. But so far,
          promises by politicians to stop fentanyl smuggling have lacked
          actionable plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          By speaking out, Rick Harrison aims to draw attention to the
          devastating human toll of the border crisis that claimed his own
          son&apos;s life. Adam&apos;s story underscores that behind the
          statistics are real families suffering immense loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Harrison family grieves privately, Rick hopes Adam&apos;s
          overdose spurs urgency in fighting the fentanyl epidemic destroying
          lives and communities across America. His emotional plea captured both
          the heartbreak of losing a child and the anger that more hasn&apos;t
          been done to prevent such tragedies.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Pawn Stars patriarch, Adam&apos;s death encapsulates the total
          failure to address border problems. By calling for real solutions,
          Rick gives voice to the experiences of too many families who have
          endured pain and loss from a crisis that keeps escalating out of
          control. His activism transforms personal tragedy into a rallying cry
          for officials to do better before more lives are senselessly lost.

          Filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar was among the select few from Bollywood
          privileged to witness the historic inauguration at the Ram Mandir in
          Ayodhya on January 22nd. Speaking from Ayodhya, he described the
          incredible energy and euphoria amongst the crowds there.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhandarkar said the vibe was vibrant and the emotion of everyone
          present was on another level. He called it a remarkable moment for all
          Indians, especially when the temple doors finally opened and Ram Lalla
          was revealed. People were overwhelmed and unable to control their
          emotions, with many moved to tears according to the director.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the doors opened, Bhandarkar said the crowds erupted in chants of
          &quot;Jai Shree Ram&quot;, clapping and cheering at getting the first
          glimpse of the idol. He called the experience emotional and
          overwhelming for everyone present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 55-year-old felt honored and privileged to be among the few from
          Bollywood included in the historic event, alongside esteemed actors,
          cricketers, filmmakers and industrialists. He said witnessing the
          inauguration was a once in a lifetime moment that he couldn&apos;t
          miss for the world.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Having eagerly looked forward to it for weeks, Bhandarkar expressed
          joy at being part of the ceremony and said it was a surreal moment he
          would cherish his whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the filmmaker, the most memorable part of the event was
          when rose petals were showered by helicopters overhead. He said seeing
          Ram Lalla&apos;s inner sanctum open as everyone cried was incredible
          beyond words.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Bhandarkar couldn&apos;t meet Prime Minister Modi, he said the
          PM looked very happy, as did the entire Bollywood contingent present
          during the celebrations.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The director also shared a viral selfie with his Fashion co-star
          Kangana Ranaut, who he called a very good friend and talented actress.
          He said they talked and clicked pictures together while seated near
          each other at the ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Bhandarkar conveyed his awe at experiencing such a
          significant spiritual and cultural milestone for India first-hand. As
          one of the few Bollywood guests present, he described the inclusive
          atmosphere and shared emotional reaction that made it a once in a
          lifetime memory to cherish.

          Deepika Padukone has been noticeably absent from promotions for her
          upcoming film Fighter, including skipping the trailer launch event
          earlier this month. In a recent interview with Bollywood Hungama,
          director Siddharth Anand addressed the speculation around
          Deepika&apos;s lack of visibility and explained it is part of their
          promotional strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about Deepika&apos;s absence and the chatter about it on
          social media, Siddharth said people often make conjectures but this
          was a deliberate decision. He revealed Deepika was meant to attend the
          trailer launch but fell ill, and would now be &quot;everywhere&quot;
          in promotions from Tuesday onwards.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Siddharth emphasized that doing promotions for Fighter without Deepika
          made no sense. He said, &quot;Obviously we can&apos;t do without
          Deepika...Deepika and Hrithik&apos;s pair is one of the major
          highlights. As a filmmaker, seeing them together is hugely exciting so
          I can only imagine the audience is also waiting for it.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the director, holding back on showing too much of Deepika
          and Hrithik before release was intentional. He wanted audiences to
          enjoy their chemistry and magic unfold on the big screen without
          reaching a saturation point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, some reports had claimed Deepika unfollowed Siddharth on
          Instagram, hinting at possible tensions. But the director clarified it
          was always the plan to have Deepika join promotions close to release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fighter stars Hrithik Roshan as Squadron Leader Shamsher Pathania,
          Deepika Padukone as Squadron Leader Minal Rathore and Anil Kapoor as
          Group Captain Rakesh Jai Singh. It revolves around the elite Air
          Dragons unit and their internal and external battles.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The high-octane action film marks Deepika and Hrithik&apos;s first
          on-screen collaboration. It is also Deepika&apos;s third project with
          director Siddharth Anand after Bachna Ae Haseeno and Pathaan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          With two of Bollywood&apos;s biggest stars paired up for the first
          time, anticipation for Fighter is sky-high. Siddharth&apos;s comments
          indicate they plan to capitalize on that buzz with Deepika front and
          center of promotions in the final run-up to release. Her millions of
          fans will undoubtedly be glad to finally see their favorite star
          highlighting the film they&apos;ve eagerly awaited.

          Ram Lalla. He attended the special event on Monday before returning to

          The megastar posted pictures of the Ram Lalla deity inside the new
          temple, as well as exterior shots of the magnificent structure. He
          included a photo of himself with folded hands, seeking blessings on
          the spiritually significant occasion. Amitabh opted for traditional
          attire and a shawl for the ceremony.{" "}

        <p>
          Describing it as a day filled with divine relevance, he wrote “Back
          from the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at Ayodhya.” Amitabh was accompanied
          to Ayodhya by his son and fellow actor Abhishek Bachchan.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          After the ceremony, Amitabh and Abhishek also met with Prime Minister
          Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Photos
          show Amitabh greeting CM Adityanath with folded hands and conversing,
          before Abhishek joined them. PM Modi also welcomed Amitabh with folded
          hands, which the screen icon returned respectfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Amitabh recently purchased a 10,000 square foot plot of
          land in Ayodhya, further showing his deep connection to the holy city.
          The registrar confirmed the ₹9 crore transaction for the property was
          completed, with Amitabh&apos;s lawyer executing the agreement on his
          behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the Bachchans, many other Bollywood celebrities like
          Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Anupam Kher, Kangana Ranaut, and Sonu Nigam
          attended the momentous Ram Mandir ceremony. With approximately 8,000
          invitees including 1,500 VIP guests, the event featured stunning
          visuals of army helicopters showering flowers on the new temple.

        <p>
          The temple trust has invited over 7,000 people including politicians,
          celebrities, cricketers, industrialists and more. Rajinikanth,
          Dhanush, Kangana Ranaut, Shefali Shah, Anupam Kher and others have
          already arrived.{" "}
        </p>

          consecration ceremony for the idol of Ram Lalla. The high-profile
          attendees highlight the significance of this historic moment for the
          Hindu community after decades of struggle.{" "}

        <p>
          The grand temple is seen as a testament to their unwavering faith and
          perseverance. While opinions may differ on the temple from a legal and
          political lens, its cultural and spiritual symbolism for devotees
          cannot be denied.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The presence of top movie stars also underlines how deeply Lord Ram
          and his ethos resonate through Indian arts and literature. As the
          auspicious rituals commence, they will likely echo the joy and pride
          of millions of devotees across India and worldwide.

          The Sankranti 2023 box office results have surprised the Telugu film
          industry. The festival period usually sees a clash between big star
          releases vying for audience attention. This year, all eyes were on
          Mahesh Babu&apos;s &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, his collaboration with
          hitmaker Trivikram Srinivas after &apos;Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo&apos;.
          But a relatively smaller film, &apos;HanuMan&apos; starring Teja
          Sajja, has emerged as the unlikely winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos; saw an upswing over the weekend but
          continued lagging behind &apos;HanuMan&apos;. On Day 9, it collected
          ₹3.25 crores domestically. Despite a jump in footfalls on Day 10, the
          film could only manage ₹3.50 crores. Its total now stands at ₹118
          crores. In contrast, &apos;HanuMan&apos; earned ₹14.6 crores on Day 9
          and a huge ₹16.50 crores on Day 10. Its domestic total has crossed
          ₹130 crores, far ahead of Mahesh Babu&apos;s film.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The other Sankranti releases - Nagarjuna&apos;s &apos;Naa Saami
          Ranga&apos; and Venkatesh&apos;s &apos;Sanidhav&apos; - have collected
          ₹26 crores and ₹14 crores respectively. Clearly, the underdog
          &apos;HanuMan&apos; has won over the audience.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This outcome has surprised many since Mahesh Babu typically has a huge
          fan following. The producer of &apos;Guntur Kaaram&apos;, Naga Vamsi,
          acknowledged issues with the film&apos;s promotion. He said late night
          1am shows sent the wrong signal for a family entertainer unlike an
          action film. Release strategies need to suit the genre, he admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critics have pointed to the film&apos;s predictable storyline and lack
          of freshness as reasons for the lukewarm response.
          &apos;HanuMan&apos;, in contrast, garnered praise for its novel
          superhero premise and CGI effects. Word-of-mouth has been a key factor
          in its rise.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sankranti battle shows the power of content over star power. For
          veteran stars like Mahesh Babu, their brand value can drive openings
          but the film needs to offer more. Underdog films can triumph with
          unique and compelling stories. Perhaps Telugu cinema is maturing
          towards scripts mattering as much as scales and stars.
