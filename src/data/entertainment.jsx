          Rumors of a new album were refuted by Britney Spears, who declared
          that she would "never return to the music industry." Spears mentioned
          in her Instagram post on Wednesday that she is still writing songs,
          but it is just for other people.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When I write, I write for fun or I write for other people !!!" she
          wrote. "I've written over 20 songs for other people the past two years
          !!! I'm a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way !!!"

          Her scathing Instagram post, "I'm turning to random people to do a new
          album," was accompanied by a picture of a Guido Reni painting
          depicting Salome clutching John the Baptist's head.

          Spears has previously stated that she will no longer be releasing her
          own music. Larry Rudolph, her longtime manager, resigned in July 2021,
          while she was still under the notorious conservatorship that ruled her
          life, finances, and voice for nearly 14 years. Rudolph stated that she
          had no plans to resume her profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that year, shortly after her conservatorship ended, she posted
          on Instagram expressing her fear of the music industry and her belief
          that not releasing her own songs was a sign of disobedience to her
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in 2022, she dropped the single "Hold Me Closer," a joint
          effort with Elton John, which peaked at No. 6 and remained on the
          Billboard Hot 100 chart for 20 weeks. The single "Mind Your Business,"
          which featured will.i.am, was not included in the Hot 100 and received
          negative reviews. 2016's "Glory" was Spears' most recent full-length
          album.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spears said in the Wednesday post that it was "far from the truth"
          that her best-selling memoir from 2023, "The Woman In Me," was
          published without her consent.
