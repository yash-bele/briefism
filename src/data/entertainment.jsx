          The new Netflix true crime documentary American Nightmare transcends
          the usual reductive tropes of the genre to deliver a piercing critique
          of flawed policing, everyday sexism, and ultimately, a moving love
          story.
        </p>

          Created by the talented team behind The Tinder Swindler, American
          Nightmare revisits a brief media frenzy from 2015 that drew
          comparisons to Gone Girl. Young blonde woman Denise Huskins was
          reported missing by her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, who claimed they were
          attacked by masked intruders who kidnapped Denise after binding and
          sedating him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cops immediately suspected Aaron was lying. Why would anyone
          kidnap Denise? Why demand a measly $15,000 ransom? And didn&apos;t
          Aaron confess to emotionally cheating on Denise because he wanted his
          ex back? Sensing Gone Girl vibes, the police zeroed in on Aaron as the
          prime suspect, threatening to label him a &quot;monster.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The case exploded when Denise suddenly reappeared at her family home
          48 hours after vanishing, traumatized and needing time to process her
          ordeal before talking to police. But the cops refused, convinced this
          was an elaborate hoax. Mere hours after Denise&apos;s return, they
          held a press conference accusing her of wasting resources on a wild
          goose chase.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare intricately recounts events through extensive
          interviews with Aaron and Denise, interrogation footage, lawyer
          inputs, and a journalist who covered the saga. The filmmakers
          skillfully cherry pick key moments to spin an engaging story while
          assuming viewer unfamiliarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the most impressive aspect is the even-handed tone taken on this
          complex case. The procedural route or salacious angle were obvious
          options passed over. Instead, American Nightmare is a remarkably
          level-headed exploration of a real-life tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s astonishing how gracefully Denise and Aaron handled the
          media maelstrom. The show calls out prejudiced press coverage and a
          gullible public ever-eager to anoint new villains just to feel morally
          superior. Even Gone Girl&apos;s Amazing Amy didn&apos;t suffer this
          degree of indignity, and she was an actual criminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the investigation proceeds, the couple&apos;s version of events
          checks out. The meticulous methodology and odd ransom demand point to
          a sophisticated extortion ring later uncovered. But the damage was
          done. Aaron&apos;s reputation and career were left in tatters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through extensive interviews, Denise and Aaron&apos;s incredible bond
          emerges, stronger than ever. We learn of Aaron&apos;s protective
          nature, traced back to his firefighter father&apos;s emphasis on
          serving others. Despite law enforcement&apos;s betrayal, the couple
          displays uncommon grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviews with willful investigators unwilling to admit mistakes
          reveal deep systemic flaws in policing - confirmation bias, sloppy
          detection, and macho posturing supersede the truth. The press comes
          off even worse, salivating for a juicy &apos;he did it&apos; plot
          instead of waiting for facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare ultimately transcends genre by training its focus
          on flawed institutions and everyday misogyny rather than
          sensationalism. An impeccably crafted, morally grounded piece, it
          serves as an inspiring example of two ordinary people displayed
          uncommon courage under fire.
