          Renowned figures from the entertainment industry, including Bad Bunny,
          Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, and Chris Hemsworth, have been designated as
          co-hosts for the upcoming Met Gala, a highly anticipated event on the
          New York social scene, as disclosed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art
          on Thursday. Collaborating with Vogue&apos;s Editor-In-Chief, Anna
          Wintour, they will lead the proceedings of the gala scheduled for May
          6, an evening that traditionally showcases the glamorous attire of the
          entertainment world&apos;s luminaries while inaugurating the annual
          exhibit at the Met&apos;s Costume Institute.

          The chosen theme for this year&apos;s event is &quot;The Garden of
          Time,&quot; inspired by the 1962 short story of the same name penned
          by English author J.G. Ballard. The theme delves into the transient
          nature of beauty, aligning with the narrative of Ballard&apos;s
          literary work. This theme resonates with the concurrent exhibit titled
          &quot;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.&quot; The exhibition
          will spotlight the most delicate pieces from the Costume
          Institute&apos;s extensive collection, visually connected by
          nature-inspired iconography. Open to the public from May 10 to
          September 2, the exhibit is a crucial element in supporting the
          Costume Institute&apos;s endeavors, including exhibitions and
          acquisitions.

          Originating in 1948, the Met Gala was initially an exclusive gathering
          for New York&apos;s elite. However, under the stewardship of Anna
          Wintour in the 1990s, it underwent a transformation from a
          high-society affair to a high-profile runway showcasing the opulent
          and famous. Beyond its societal prominence, the gala has evolved into
          a captivating spectacle on social media platforms, further enhancing
          its cultural significance.

          BTS sensation Jungkook&apos;s impact has proven unparalleled, notably
          contributing to HYBE&apos;s remarkable fourth-quarter operational
          profit surge in 2023. KB Securities, on February 15, recognized
          Jungkook as a key factor behind HYBE&apos;s substantial operational
          profit of KRW 94.9 billion (approximately Rs 590 crore) during Q4
          2023. This figure reflects an impressive 86% increase compared to the
          same period the previous year, marking the highest quarterly
          performance in the company&apos;s history. Researcher Lee Seon-hwa
          specifically credited the sales from Jungkook&apos;s debut solo album,
          along with contributions from SEVENTEEN and ENHYPEN&apos;s releases,
          as instrumental in achieving this milestone. Jungkook stood out as the
          sole soloist acknowledged for significantly impacting HYBE&apos;s
          profitability.

          Despite these successes, KB Securities revised HYBE&apos;s target
          stock price from 330,000 won (about Rs 20,000) to 300,000 won (about
          Rs 18,000). This adjustment was attributed to an anticipated decline
          in operational profit, influenced by changes in strategy resulting
          from BTS&apos; absence and the impending enlistment of SEVENTEEN
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of Jungkook&apos;s individual endeavors, following his solo
          debut with &quot;Seven&quot; in July 2023, a collaborative project
          with The Kid LAROI, and the release of his first solo album
          &quot;Golden&quot; in November of the same year, Jungkook commenced
          his mandatory military service alongside Jimin on December 12.
          Following a five-week basic military training period, both Jimin and
          Jungkook reportedly joined the 5th Infantry Division, the same
          division as their bandmate Jin. Currently, all seven BTS members are
          serving in the South Korean Army, and a group reunion is anticipated
          by June 2025.

          Millie Bobby Brown is poised to headline the upcoming fantasy film,
          Damsel, set for release on March 8. Netflix recently unveiled a
          striking poster featuring Brown in a fierce stance, wielding a sword
          against menacing monsters, accompanied by the tagline, &quot;This is
          not a fairytale.&quot; The caption emphasizes Millie&apos;s quest to
          conquer the monsters in Damsel, exclusively on Netflix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, Damsel follows
          the story of Princess Elodie, portrayed by Millie, who is chosen by
          her queen for marriage to a handsome prince. However, her world
          unravels when she discovers that she is merely a pawn in a scheme by
          the royal family to settle an ancient debt – a sacrificial offering.
          Confronted with a fire-breathing dragon in a cave, Princess Elodie
          must battle for survival.

          The film&apos;s teaser trailer, released earlier, sets a chilling tone
          as Millie&apos;s character navigates eerie woods reminiscent of a
          fairytale nightmare. Accompanied by Timber Timbre&apos;s haunting
          &quot;Run From Me,&quot; the teaser hints at Princess Elodie&apos;s
          resourcefulness, showcasing her creating a makeshift rope from her
          clothes to scale a cavern of sharp crystal spikes. Narrowly escaping
          peril, she raises her sword in readiness to combat the dungeon&apos;s
          dragon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damsel boasts a stellar ensemble cast, featuring Nick Robinson as
          Prince Henry, Ray Winstone as the King, Brooke Carter as Prince
          Henry&apos;s younger sister, and Ricky Guillart as Sir Oded. Angela
          Bassett and Robin Wright deliver standout performances as Lady Bayford
          and Queen Isabelle, respectively. The film also includes Shoreh
          Aghdashloo, Sam Sharma, Sonya Nisa, Erickson Santos Gomes, Elmano
          Sancho, and Saif Mohsen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally slated for release on October 13 of the previous year,
          Damsel&apos;s premiere was rescheduled to 2024. Penned by Dan Mazeau,
          the film is produced by Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum. As
          anticipation builds for Millie Bobby Brown&apos;s portrayal of the
          resilient Princess Elodie, Damsel promises an enthralling fantasy
          adventure filled with suspense and action.
