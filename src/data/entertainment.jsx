        <p>
          In his debut feature film, &quot;All India Rank,&quot; Varun Grover
          diverges from the familiar themes of academic pressure and competitive
          zeal depicted in &quot;12th Fail&quot; and &quot;Kota Factory.&quot;
          Instead, he crafts a narrative that prioritizes characters and
          emotions, particularly the nuances of first love, while critically
          examining the toll exacted by the education system. One pivotal scene
          underscores this perspective, where the protagonist&apos;s father,
          acknowledging the importance of decency over academic success, imparts
          a poignant lesson about life&apos;s richness beyond mere achievements.
          Grover&apos;s film stands in stark contrast to the detached portrayal
          of its subjects in &quot;12th Fail&quot; and the rage-fueled ethos of
          &quot;Kota Factory.&quot; Unlike these predecessors, &quot;All India
          Rank&quot; offers a tender exploration of human experiences, serving
          as a refreshing departure from prevailing entertainment trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          In confronting the middle-class struggle, Grover appears to be
          introspectively grappling with his own past, infusing the film with
          elements reminiscent of trauma survival. Through the character of
          Vivek, a student navigating the pressures of Kota, Grover captures the
          paradox of youthful potential stifled by suffocating constraints,
          echoing Dickens&apos; sentiment of life&apos;s duality. Despite the
          backdrop of a coaching hub, the film transcends its setting, emerging
          as a poignant coming-of-age tale. Vivek&apos;s realization of his own
          ordinariness amidst the masses reflects a profound truth about
          identity and societal expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          While &quot;12th Fail&quot; and &quot;Kota Factory&quot; merely depict
          the harsh realities of the education system, Grover&apos;s film dares
          to interrogate its injustices. It questions why quality education
          remains elusive for many, why children are sacrificed at the altar of
          parental aspirations, and why talents remain undiscovered or
          neglected. Moreover, it condemns the normalization of student
          suffering, as evidenced by the callous response to suicide prevention
          measures in dormitories. Grover lays bare the systemic failures that
          perpetuate societal inequities, challenging audiences to confront
          uncomfortable truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a society where turmoil is all but guaranteed for most, &quot;All
          India Rank&quot; refuses to romanticize adversity. It demands
          accountability from a system that commodifies children&apos;s futures
          and from individuals who view offspring as investments. The
          film&apos;s portrayal of Vivek&apos;s father as a flawed yet evolving
          figure serves as a powerful allegory for generational change and
          societal responsibility. Grover&apos;s narrative rejects the allure of
          wealth as life&apos;s sole pursuit, instead advocating for a broader
          understanding of success and fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;All India Rank&quot; recognizes that true progress requires
          systemic change, not just individual resilience. It critiques the
          societal pressures that compel individuals to chase elusive social
          mobility, offering a nuanced exploration of the aspirations and
          struggles inherent in this pursuit. Vivek&apos;s father&apos;s
          capacity for introspection signifies hope for a future where
          collective consciousness drives meaningful transformation. Through its
          introspective lens, &quot;All India Rank&quot; compels viewers to
          question prevailing narratives of success and to envision a more
          equitable future.

          Filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia recently discussed the emergence of
          politically charged films in India, criticizing them as lacking
          artistic depth. In an interview with the Red Mike YouTube channel, he
          compared these films unfavorably to the works of acclaimed directors
          like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, noting their inability to
          establish a distinct directorial identity. Dhulia specifically singled
          out films such as The Kashmir Files, dismissing them as aesthetically
          poor and unworthy of discussion.

        <p>
          Drawing a contrast between Spielberg&apos;s adherence to Hollywood
          conventions and Scorsese&apos;s unmistakable directorial style rooted
          in strong ideologies, Dhulia emphasized the importance of a
          filmmaker&apos;s beliefs in shaping their cinematic voice. While
          acknowledging that some Indian directors may genuinely espouse the
          political messages in their films, Dhulia lamented their lack of
          artistic prowess in execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dhulia expressed concern over the trend of using cinema as a platform
          for political propaganda, condemning the substandard quality of such
          films in India. Unlike the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will,
          which Dhulia credited for pushing the boundaries of filmmaking despite
          its propagandistic nature, he criticized Indian propaganda films for
          prioritizing profit over artistic integrity. Notably, he cited The
          Kashmir Files, directed by Vivek Agnihotri, as a prime example of this
          phenomenon, citing its commercial success but criticizing its
          historical inaccuracies and sensationalist approach.

          tracker Sacnilk, the film, starring Yami Gautam, garnered
          approximately Rs 3.25 crore nett on Tuesday. This figure matches the
          earnings from its first Monday, indicating a positive trend in box
          office performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Domestically, the film has accumulated Rs 29.40 crore thus far, with
          projections suggesting it will conclude its first week with around Rs
          35 crore. Directed by National Award-winning filmmaker Aditya
          Jambhale, &quot;Article 370&quot; had an impressive worldwide opening
          weekend, reaching nearly Rs 35 crore, as reported by the producers.
          Considering the collections from Monday and Tuesday, the film is
          expected to surpass the Rs 40 crore mark globally. Its target is now
          set on crossing Rs 50 crore before the end of the week.

          is poised for continued success.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, the next significant release is Ajay Devgn&apos;s
          horror drama &quot;Shaitaan,&quot; scheduled for March 8, followed by
          Sidharth Malhotra starrer action film &quot;Yodha.&quot; By then,

          knot in June 2021 and are expecting a baby, have set high standards
          with &quot;Article 370,&quot; aligning it with recent politically

          During the 1980s, as the ghazal genre gained prominence in Indian
          music, a deeply moving poem depicting a father&apos;s emotions upon
          receiving a letter from home resonated profoundly with the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The song &quot;Chitthi aayi hai&quot; touched millions, particularly
          the diaspora, stirring tears with lines like &quot;You&apos;ve earned
          a lot of money, it made you leave your country&quot; and &quot;Leave
          this strange country and come back, break this cage, O bird, come
          back,&quot; evoking memories and longings for home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pankaj Udhas, who infused his soul into these lyrics penned by Anand
          Bakshi for Mahesh Bhatt&apos;s film &quot;Naam&quot; (1986), passed
          away at the age of 72 after battling pancreatic cancer for months at
          Mumbai&apos;s Breach Candy Hospital on Monday. He is survived by his
          older brothers Manhar and Nirmal, wife Farida, and daughters Nayaab
          and Rewa.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;With a heavy heart, we announce the sad demise of Padmashri
          Pankaj Udhas on 26th February 2024 due to a prolonged illness,&quot;
          wrote his daughter Nayaab in an Instagram post. The singer&apos;s last
          rites will be conducted on Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among
          those mourning Udhas&apos;s death. Modi praised Udhas as a beacon of
          Indian music whose melodies transcended generations, acknowledging
          their interactions over the years and expressing condolences to his
          family and fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the emotional impact of &quot;Chitthi aayi hai,&quot; numerous
          stories emerged of people returning home from abroad or feeling a deep
          yearning to reunite with loved ones. This phenomenon propelled Udhas,
          despite his ordinary voice, to prominence in the ghazal world
          alongside stalwarts like Mehdi Hasan, Ghulam Ali, and Jagjit Singh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in 1951 in Jetpur, Gujarat, Udhas hailed from a family with a
          passion for music. His father, a farmer, played the dilruba and
          encouraged Udhas and his brothers to delve into music from a young
          age. Udhas initially learned tabla at the Sangeet Natya Akademi in
          Rajkot before gravitating towards vocal classical music under the
          guidance of Master Navrang Nagpurkar in Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          His exposure to ghazals during his time at St Xavier&apos;s sparked
          his interest in the genre, leading him to learn Urdu from a tutor and
          delve deeper into its intricacies. Despite facing challenges breaking
          into the playback singing scene dominated by established voices, Udhas
          persevered, driven by his love for ghazals and the receptive audience
          abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early 1980s, Udhas released notable ghazal albums like
          &quot;Aahat&quot; (1980) and &quot;Nayaab&quot; (1985), but it was
          &quot;Chitthi aayi hai&quot; that catapulted him to fame. Subsequent
          hits like &quot;Jeeye to jeeye kaise&quot; from &quot;Saajan&quot;
          (1991), &quot;Mohra&quot; (1994), and &quot;Chandi jaisa rang hai
          tera&quot; (2001) cemented his popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Udhas&apos;s contributions extended beyond ghazals; he ventured into
          indie pop with songs like &quot;Ahista&quot; and founded the ghazal
          festival &quot;Khazana.&quot; Despite halting performances due to
          illness, his impact on Indian music remains indelible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Udhas&apos;s passing, the country mourns the loss of a voice that
          stirred countless emotions and left an enduring legacy in the world of
          music, as acknowledged by Yash Raj Films.

          by English author J.G. Ballard. The theme delves into the transient
          nature of beauty, aligning with the narrative of Ballard&apos;s
          literary work. This theme resonates with the concurrent exhibit titled
          &quot;Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.&quot; The exhibition
          will spotlight the most delicate pieces from the Costume
          Institute&apos;s extensive collection, visually connected by
          nature-inspired iconography. Open to the public from May 10 to
          September 2, the exhibit is a crucial element in supporting the
          Costume Institute&apos;s endeavors, including exhibitions and
          acquisitions.

          Originating in 1948, the Met Gala was initially an exclusive gathering
          for New York&apos;s elite. However, under the stewardship of Anna
          Wintour in the 1990s, it underwent a transformation from a
          high-society affair to a high-profile runway showcasing the opulent
          and famous. Beyond its societal prominence, the gala has evolved into
          a captivating spectacle on social media platforms, further enhancing
          its cultural significance.

          Despite these successes, KB Securities revised HYBE&apos;s target
          stock price from 330,000 won (about Rs 20,000) to 300,000 won (about
          Rs 18,000). This adjustment was attributed to an anticipated decline
          in operational profit, influenced by changes in strategy resulting
          from BTS&apos; absence and the impending enlistment of SEVENTEEN
          members.

          In terms of Jungkook&apos;s individual endeavors, following his solo
          debut with &quot;Seven&quot; in July 2023, a collaborative project
          with The Kid LAROI, and the release of his first solo album
          &quot;Golden&quot; in November of the same year, Jungkook commenced
          his mandatory military service alongside Jimin on December 12.
          Following a five-week basic military training period, both Jimin and
          Jungkook reportedly joined the 5th Infantry Division, the same
          division as their bandmate Jin. Currently, all seven BTS members are
          serving in the South Korean Army, and a group reunion is anticipated
          by June 2025.
