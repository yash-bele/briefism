          Actor Manisha Rani clinched the title of Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 11 winner
          on Saturday night, securing the prize of Rs 30 lakh and a trip to Yas
          Islands, Abu Dhabi. She made her entry into the show as a wild card
          contestant, marking the first instance in the show&apos;s history
          where a wild card contender emerged victorious. Post her triumph,
          Manisha shared her aspirations of venturing into Bollywood, expressing
          her desire to work in a film alongside Kartik Aaryan.

          Reflecting on her victory, Manisha expressed sheer delight, stating,
          &quot;I feel very happy. I still cannot believe that the trophy is in
          my hand. It is like a dream come true.&quot; Addressing the uncommon
          achievement of a wild card contestant winning the show, she remarked,
          &quot;Earlier I used to think that since I came in as a wild card, I
          might not win. People are skeptical about coming as wild cards because
          90 per cent of the time they don’t win as they don’t get the time to
          prove themselves. By the time we join the show, half the season has
          passed, and people have made their mark already. But if in little time
          you can do what others were not able to do from the start, then you
          can win. Hard work is the key. I experimented with various dance forms
          in my journey, and I got very little time to prove myself, but I am
          glad I did.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Manisha revealed grappling with moments of self-doubt during her
          journey on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa, admitting, &quot;I have thought of
          giving up many times on this Jhalak journey, I felt I couldn’t do it,
          but then that hunger to win the trophy kept me going.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Eyeing a career in Bollywood, Manisha aims to enhance her skills and
          delve into acting. She disclosed her top three actors she wishes to
          collaborate with, stating, &quot;I have always wanted to work with
          Salman Khan and Kartik Aaryan. Shahid Kapoor is my favorite actor. So
          I would love to share the screen with them.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In a touching gesture, Manisha shared her intentions to utilize the
          prize money from Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 11 to support people, following
          her previous initiative of sponsoring education for 11 girls in
          November.

          While some entrepreneurs have found success through Shark Tank India,
          others have left empty-handed. Among them is Recode, a cosmetics brand
          that gained significant attention on the show, leading to a
          substantial increase in its valuation. Co-founders Rahul and Dheeraj
          appeared on the show&apos;s second season seeking Rs 1 crore in
          funding for 1% equity, valuing the company at Rs 100 crore.

          The sharks were surprised by the valuation and the company&apos;s
          revenue, which reached Rs 15 crore in the previous financial year.
          Additionally, the founders disclosed their unconventional marketing
          strategy of offering free grooming lessons and lunch to college girls.

        <p>
          Aman Gupta and Namita Thapar withdrew from the deal due to personal
          connections with competitors, while Peyush Bansal expressed concerns
          about branding. Anupam Mittal acknowledged the founders&apos;
          impressive organic reach but declined to invest, leaving Recode with
          publicity but no deal.

        <p>
          The company&apos;s Brand Development Head, Ishani Trehan, highlighted
          Shark Tank&apos;s impact, noting the limited focus on financials
          during discussions. Despite the rejection, the publicity from the show
          significantly boosted Recode&apos;s brand awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to India Today, Recode&apos;s valuation has soared to Rs 240
          crore, Rs 140 crore higher than the Shark Tank estimate. The show

          Television personality Ankita Lokhande, renowned for her role in the
          Indian soap opera &quot;Pavitra Rishta,&quot; along with her spouse
          Vicky Jain, have garnered attention for their unique dining habits,
          especially during their travels abroad. Notably, Ankita disclosed a
          recent trip to Paris where she carried homemade thepla, a type of
          Indian flatbread, underscoring their preference for familiar tastes
          over exploring new cuisines.

        <p>
          In a recent interview with Mashable India, Ankita expressed their
          inclination towards home-cooked meals, emphasizing their penchant for
          simple Indian fare such as dal, sabzi, and roti. She elucidated that
          despite being self-proclaimed food enthusiasts, their definition of
          indulgence revolves around quintessential Indian dishes like pav
          bhaji, bhindi (okra), and chaat (savory snacks), rather than venturing
          into unfamiliar culinary territories. This culinary conservatism
          extends to their dining habits abroad, with Ankita revealing that they
          abstain from eating out and instead opt to carry provisions like
          thepla and achaar (pickle) even on trips to destinations like Paris,
          citing a longing for the comforting flavors of home-cooked food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on their marriage, which spans over two years, Ankita
          disclosed their joint participation in the reality TV show &quot;Bigg
          Boss 17,&quot; where their dynamic interactions captivated audiences.
          Despite their differences, including occasional disagreements
          showcased on the show, the couple&apos;s unified stance on culinary
          preferences underscores their shared values and routines. While Vicky
          Jain exited the show prior to the finale, Ankita&apos;s journey
          culminated in a commendable fourth-place finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, Ankita Lokhande and Vicky Jain&apos;s culinary choices not
          only reflect their personal preferences but also highlight their
          unwavering attachment to traditional Indian flavors, even in the midst
          of global exploration and media attention.

          Hailey and Justin Bieber&apos;s relationship, always under scrutiny,
          is currently drawing attention for reasons other than their public
          displays of affection or past relationships. Instead, it&apos;s
          centered around a challenging phase they&apos;re navigating. Recently,
          Hailey&apos;s father, Stephen Baldwin, made a plea on Instagram for
          prayers for his daughter and son-in-law. However, TMZ reports that
          Hailey isn&apos;t pleased with this public disclosure.

          In a recent social media post, Stephen Baldwin referred to a personal
          matter involving his daughter and son-in-law, sparking conversations
          and mixed reactions. Sources suggest that this post might have caused
          tension within the family, as it was not a spontaneous request but
          related to a specific issue the couple is facing.

          While the exact nature of the couple&apos;s problems remains
          undisclosed, reports indicate that both Justin and Hailey are
          grappling with deeply personal or marital issues. Observers noted
          their somber demeanor as they exited a Los Angeles church, hinting at
          underlying troubles that were previously overlooked.

          Reports suggest that the 27-year-old model is displeased with her
          marital problems being exposed to the public. This situation stemmed
          from Stephen Baldwin&apos;s repost of an Instagram photo featuring
          Justin, 29, singing a worship song. The caption urged Christians to
          pray for wisdom, protection, and spiritual closeness for the couple.
          Stephen highlighted the challenges faced by individuals in the
          limelight and the spiritual warfare they endure, emphasizing the need
          for support through prayer.
