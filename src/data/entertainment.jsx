          Talented actor Bhumi Pednekar is set to deliver another powerful
          performance in the upcoming Netflix investigative drama Bhakshak.
          Produced by Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan&apos;s renowned production
          house Red Chillies Entertainment, the highly anticipated film is
          slated for release on Netflix on February 9th.

          Bhumi unveiled the intense teaser on social media, describing it as
          the story of a committed journalist who perseveres to uncover the
          truth no matter what. Bhakshak is inspired by real life events that
          took place in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teaser provides a glimpse of Bhumi portraying the role of Vaishali
          Singh, a determined investigative journalist seeking to expose a
          horrific crime and shed light on the dismal reality of violence
          against women in society. Commenting on the film&apos;s hard-hitting
          theme, the director expressed that the aim is to highlight difficult
          realities and generate meaningful conversations that can lead to
          positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaurav Verma, producer at Red Chillies Entertainment, conveyed that
          they believe in storytelling that not only engages audiences but also
          enlightens them. He described Bhakshak as a testimony to their
          commitment to thought-provoking narratives that encourage social
          reflections. They are excited to partner with Netflix to share this
          impactful story with global audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruchikaa Kapoor Sheikh from Netflix India added that Bhakshak is an
          intense story following a resolute journalist&apos;s unfaltering
          pursuit of justice against all obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helmed by director Pulkit, Bhakshak also features impressive
          performances by Sanjay Mishra, Aditya Srivastava and Sai Tamhankar
          essaying pivotal roles. But Bhumi takes centerstage in her portrayal
          of the fierce journalist at the heart of this hard-hitting story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set to premiere exclusively on Netflix on February 9th, the promising
          investigative drama marks another career defining performance by Bhumi
          Pednekar in the central role.

          Prabhas surprised fans by opting for a romantic horror-comedy with
          director Maruthi instead of a massive project like Salaar. The
          film&apos;s poster, featuring Prabhas in a casual look with a shirt
          and lungi, was unveiled on Sankranthi, generating curiosity among
          fans. The IMDb page for the movie added to the excitement as it
          revealed the plot line.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the IMDb synopsis, the film revolves around a couple in
          love who must alter their destiny due to negative energy. This
          description sparked speculation among fans about the storyline.
          However, the director, Maruthi, clarified the situation with a playful
          comment on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a platform called X, Maruthi expressed, &quot;Ararare, I don‚Äôt know
          this plot. So shooting with a different script. Ippudu IMDB Samajam

          This statement makes it clear that the plot mentioned on IMDb is not
          the current focus of Prabhas and Maruthi&apos;s collaboration. Similar
          to many high-budget projects, the details of the film&apos;s storyline
          are likely to remain under wraps until the trailer is released, which
          might take some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, Prabhas is gearing up for his next major project,
          &quot;Kalki 2898 AD,&quot; directed by Nag Ashwin. This dystopian
          sci-fi thriller, featuring Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, and Deepika
          Padukone, is scheduled for release later this year.
