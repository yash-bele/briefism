          As Valentine’s Day approaches, streaming platforms are preparing to
          offer a selection of romantic content for cozy nights in. Prime Video
          is set to launch a series titled &apos;Love Storiyaan&apos; on
          February 14th, aligning with the day synonymous with love and romance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show, featuring the creative vision of six directors - Akshay
          Indikar, Archana Phadke, Collin D’Cunha, Hardik Mehta, Shazia Iqbal,
          and Vivek Soni - is produced by Dharmatic Entertainment. Executive
          Producers Karan Johar, Apoorva Mehta, and Somen Mishra lead the
          project, drawing inspiration from the narratives showcased on the
          India Love Project, a social media platform founded by former
          journalists Priya Ramani, Samar Halarnkar, and Niloufer Venkatraman,
          dedicated to celebrating love in all its forms.

          Aparna Purohit, head of Originals for India and Southeast Asia at
          Prime Video, stated, “Love Storiyaan epitomizes Prime Video’s
          dedication to crafting stories that authentically reflect the
          diversity of our audience while deeply resonating with their emotions.
          This series unveils genuine and uplifting love stories that transcend
          societal norms, inviting viewers into a world where love knows no
          boundaries. With its poignant storytelling, it’s sure to strike a
          chord with audiences.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Karan Johar shared insights on the project, mentioning, “Love
          Storiyaan goes beyond being a mere recounting of real-life tales of
          love. It explores love in all its facets, painting a beautiful mosaic
          of connections that surpass the ordinary.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on the project, Johar added, “Throughout my career as a
          filmmaker and producer, I’ve had the privilege of narrating numerous
          love stories that have shaped the Indian cinema genre. However, what
          struck me about the India Love Project, which aided in curating these
          stories, was the rawness and individuality of each narrative. These
          are the stories of real individuals, hailing from diverse backgrounds,
          who encountered significant obstacles in their quest for true love.
          Yet, they exhibited resilience and determination, breaking through
          cultural, religious, gender, and even wartime barriers. This marks our
          maiden venture into presenting real stories of real people to our
          audiences.”

          BTS, the globally celebrated K-pop sensation, has left an enduring
          mark on the Grammy Awards stage, showcasing a blend of talent and
          charisma through a presentation, three dynamic performances, and four
          memorable appearances. Remarkably, BTS stands as the sole K-pop act
          with five Grammy nominations, underscoring their profound influence
          and artistic prowess. Let&apos;s revisit the remarkable instances when
          BTS graced the Grammy Awards with their unparalleled presence and
          musical brilliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In their debut appearance at the 2019 Grammy Awards, BTS captivated
          audiences with their impeccable style, adorned in black-and-white
          tuxedos. During a red carpet interview, they tantalized fans with
          hints of upcoming music, creating anticipation for their impending
          album. Expressing excitement about potential collaborations, BTS
          mentioned dream partners like H.E.R., Travis Scott, Lady Gaga, and
          Camila Cabello. Their infectious joy peaked as they performed Dolly
          Parton&apos;s &quot;Jolene&quot; in a special segment, marking a
          historic moment as the first K-pop group to present a Grammy award—
          Best R&B Album to H.E.R., achieving a monumental milestone.
        </p>
        <p>
          BTS continued to showcase their star power at the 2020 Grammys with a
          dynamic performance of &quot;Seoul Town Road,&quot; a remix of Lil Nas
          X&apos;s &quot;Old Town Road&quot; featuring RM. Collaborating with
          artists like Lil Nas X, Mason Ramsey, Billy Ray Cyrus, Diplo, and Nas,
          the South Korean boy band delivered a memorable show. Although it was
          their first Grammy performance, the decision to include them in a
          collaborative act stirred discussions about their global influence and
          chart-topping success deserving a solo spotlight. Despite the
          oversight in nominations, BTS&apos;s presence marked a significant
          step forward, demonstrating their ability to captivate Western
          audiences and leaving fans optimistic for future recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2021 Grammy Awards witnessed BTS making history as the first
          Korean pop artist recognized by the Recording Academy. Although they
          didn&apos;t secure a win in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance
          category for &quot;Dynamite,&quot; their vibrant performance stole the
          spotlight. Broadcasting from Seoul, South Korea, BTS brought their
          Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper to life with energetic choreography,
          high kicks, and infectious smiles. Seamlessly integrating their
          performance with the Grammy Awards&apos; Los Angeles set, it became
          one of the night&apos;s most memorable moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the stage at the 64th Grammy Awards, BTS performed
          &quot;Butter&quot; and continued to add to their Grammy legacy with a
          nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Displaying versatility
          and showmanship, the group transformed into suave super spies in a
          James Bond and Mission Impossible-inspired environment. Clad in sleek
          black suits and despite Jin&apos;s hand cast, they delivered a
          flawless show that garnered a standing ovation, reaffirming their
          status as a global phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
          On November 15 of the previous year, BTS received three nominations at
          the 65th Annual Grammy Awards. Notably, &quot;Yet to Come&quot; earned
          a nod for Best Music Video, and their collaboration with Coldplay,
          &quot;My Universe,&quot; was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group
          Performance. This accomplishment solidified BTS as the only act with
          three consecutive nominations in this category since its introduction
          in 2011. Additionally, the band earned a nomination for Album of the
          Year for their collaboration on Coldplay&apos;s &quot;Music of the
          Spheres.&quot; Despite their nominations, none of the BTS members
          attended the annual award ceremony.

          Millie Bobby Brown is poised to headline the upcoming fantasy film,
          Damsel, set for release on March 8. Netflix recently unveiled a
          striking poster featuring Brown in a fierce stance, wielding a sword
          against menacing monsters, accompanied by the tagline, &quot;This is
          not a fairytale.&quot; The caption emphasizes Millie&apos;s quest to
          conquer the monsters in Damsel, exclusively on Netflix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by Spanish filmmaker Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, Damsel follows
          the story of Princess Elodie, portrayed by Millie, who is chosen by
          her queen for marriage to a handsome prince. However, her world
          unravels when she discovers that she is merely a pawn in a scheme by
          the royal family to settle an ancient debt – a sacrificial offering.
          Confronted with a fire-breathing dragon in a cave, Princess Elodie
          must battle for survival.

          The film&apos;s teaser trailer, released earlier, sets a chilling tone
          as Millie&apos;s character navigates eerie woods reminiscent of a
          fairytale nightmare. Accompanied by Timber Timbre&apos;s haunting
          &quot;Run From Me,&quot; the teaser hints at Princess Elodie&apos;s
          resourcefulness, showcasing her creating a makeshift rope from her
          clothes to scale a cavern of sharp crystal spikes. Narrowly escaping
          peril, she raises her sword in readiness to combat the dungeon&apos;s
          dragon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damsel boasts a stellar ensemble cast, featuring Nick Robinson as
          Prince Henry, Ray Winstone as the King, Brooke Carter as Prince
          Henry&apos;s younger sister, and Ricky Guillart as Sir Oded. Angela
          Bassett and Robin Wright deliver standout performances as Lady Bayford
          and Queen Isabelle, respectively. The film also includes Shoreh
          Aghdashloo, Sam Sharma, Sonya Nisa, Erickson Santos Gomes, Elmano
          Sancho, and Saif Mohsen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally slated for release on October 13 of the previous year,
          Damsel&apos;s premiere was rescheduled to 2024. Penned by Dan Mazeau,
          the film is produced by Joe Roth and Jeff Kirschenbaum. As
          anticipation builds for Millie Bobby Brown&apos;s portrayal of the
          resilient Princess Elodie, Damsel promises an enthralling fantasy
          adventure filled with suspense and action.
