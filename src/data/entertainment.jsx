          On February 29, South Korean media outlet SPOTV disclosed that the
          25-year-old actor is preparing to establish his own One Man Company
          following the imminent expiration of his contract with C-Jes. Lee Jae

          like Choi Min Shik, Ra Mi Ran, Ryu Jun Yeo, and Moon So Ri, for three
          years. However, his contract is set to conclude in April. Since
          joining the studio, the &quot;Extraordinary You&quot; actor has gained
          significant recognition. As speculations gained momentum, his current
          agency issued a concise response.

          fashion event, with their bond strengthening as they spent time
          together in Seoul. While both their agencies initially took time to

          Hailey and Justin Bieber&apos;s relationship, always under scrutiny,

          Hailey&apos;s father, Stephen Baldwin, made a plea on Instagram for

          Hailey isn&apos;t pleased with this public disclosure.

          In a recent social media post, Stephen Baldwin referred to a personal
          matter involving his daughter and son-in-law, sparking conversations
          and mixed reactions. Sources suggest that this post might have caused
          tension within the family, as it was not a spontaneous request but
          related to a specific issue the couple is facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the exact nature of the couple&apos;s problems remains
          undisclosed, reports indicate that both Justin and Hailey are
          grappling with deeply personal or marital issues. Observers noted
          their somber demeanor as they exited a Los Angeles church, hinting at
          underlying troubles that were previously overlooked.

        <p>
          Reports suggest that the 27-year-old model is displeased with her
          marital problems being exposed to the public. This situation stemmed
          from Stephen Baldwin&apos;s repost of an Instagram photo featuring
          Justin, 29, singing a worship song. The caption urged Christians to
          pray for wisdom, protection, and spiritual closeness for the couple.
          Stephen highlighted the challenges faced by individuals in the
          limelight and the spiritual warfare they endure, emphasizing the need
          for support through prayer.

          A notable change comes with the title adjustment: Superman: Legacy is
          now simply SUPERMAN. Regardless, it&apos;s a fitting name for the
          grand cinematic revival of the Man of Steel. With James Gunn leading
          the charge and a substantial budget in play, fans are optimistic about
          the visual extravaganza that the upcoming Superman film promises to
          deliver. Gunn himself shared insights into the title evolution,
          explaining that while the initial draft was named Superman: Legacy,
          the final script solidified the title as SUPERMAN, as revealed in his
          Instagram post.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an unexpected twist, James Gunn took to Instagram to unveil
          Superman&apos;s new suit, coinciding with the start of principal
          photography on SUPERMAN, which intriguingly aligns with
          Superman&apos;s birthday on February 29. The costume teaser shared on
          Instagram has sparked discussions among fans, particularly regarding
          the emblem&apos;s resemblance to Superman from the Kingdom Come
          storyline by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, set in a parallel reality in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          But fear not, fans! Despite the striking similarity in appearance, the
          storyline promises freshness and novelty. While both versions of
          Superman from Kingdom Come and the DC Universe (DCU) bear resemblance,
          they remain distinct characters. Kingdom Come&apos;s Superman is
          depicted as older and seasoned, contrasting with the DCU&apos;s Clark
          Kent, who is portrayed as younger and at the outset of his superhero
          journey.

          In his debut feature film, &quot;All India Rank,&quot; Varun Grover
          diverges from the familiar themes of academic pressure and competitive
          zeal depicted in &quot;12th Fail&quot; and &quot;Kota Factory.&quot;
          Instead, he crafts a narrative that prioritizes characters and
          emotions, particularly the nuances of first love, while critically
          examining the toll exacted by the education system. One pivotal scene
          underscores this perspective, where the protagonist&apos;s father,
          acknowledging the importance of decency over academic success, imparts
          a poignant lesson about life&apos;s richness beyond mere achievements.
          Grover&apos;s film stands in stark contrast to the detached portrayal
          of its subjects in &quot;12th Fail&quot; and the rage-fueled ethos of
          &quot;Kota Factory.&quot; Unlike these predecessors, &quot;All India
          Rank&quot; offers a tender exploration of human experiences, serving
          as a refreshing departure from prevailing entertainment trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          In confronting the middle-class struggle, Grover appears to be
          introspectively grappling with his own past, infusing the film with
          elements reminiscent of trauma survival. Through the character of
          Vivek, a student navigating the pressures of Kota, Grover captures the
          paradox of youthful potential stifled by suffocating constraints,
          echoing Dickens&apos; sentiment of life&apos;s duality. Despite the
          backdrop of a coaching hub, the film transcends its setting, emerging
          as a poignant coming-of-age tale. Vivek&apos;s realization of his own
          ordinariness amidst the masses reflects a profound truth about
          identity and societal expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          While &quot;12th Fail&quot; and &quot;Kota Factory&quot; merely depict
          the harsh realities of the education system, Grover&apos;s film dares
          to interrogate its injustices. It questions why quality education
          remains elusive for many, why children are sacrificed at the altar of
          parental aspirations, and why talents remain undiscovered or
          neglected. Moreover, it condemns the normalization of student
          suffering, as evidenced by the callous response to suicide prevention
          measures in dormitories. Grover lays bare the systemic failures that
          perpetuate societal inequities, challenging audiences to confront
          uncomfortable truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a society where turmoil is all but guaranteed for most, &quot;All
          India Rank&quot; refuses to romanticize adversity. It demands
          accountability from a system that commodifies children&apos;s futures
          and from individuals who view offspring as investments. The
          film&apos;s portrayal of Vivek&apos;s father as a flawed yet evolving
          figure serves as a powerful allegory for generational change and
          societal responsibility. Grover&apos;s narrative rejects the allure of
          wealth as life&apos;s sole pursuit, instead advocating for a broader
          understanding of success and fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;All India Rank&quot; recognizes that true progress requires
          systemic change, not just individual resilience. It critiques the
          societal pressures that compel individuals to chase elusive social
          mobility, offering a nuanced exploration of the aspirations and
          struggles inherent in this pursuit. Vivek&apos;s father&apos;s
          capacity for introspection signifies hope for a future where
          collective consciousness drives meaningful transformation. Through its
          introspective lens, &quot;All India Rank&quot; compels viewers to
          question prevailing narratives of success and to envision a more
          equitable future.

          Filmmaker Tigmanshu Dhulia recently discussed the emergence of
          politically charged films in India, criticizing them as lacking
          artistic depth. In an interview with the Red Mike YouTube channel, he
          compared these films unfavorably to the works of acclaimed directors
          like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, noting their inability to
          establish a distinct directorial identity. Dhulia specifically singled
          out films such as The Kashmir Files, dismissing them as aesthetically
          poor and unworthy of discussion.

        <p>
          Drawing a contrast between Spielberg&apos;s adherence to Hollywood
          conventions and Scorsese&apos;s unmistakable directorial style rooted
          in strong ideologies, Dhulia emphasized the importance of a
          filmmaker&apos;s beliefs in shaping their cinematic voice. While
          acknowledging that some Indian directors may genuinely espouse the
          political messages in their films, Dhulia lamented their lack of
          artistic prowess in execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dhulia expressed concern over the trend of using cinema as a platform
          for political propaganda, condemning the substandard quality of such
          films in India. Unlike the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will,
          which Dhulia credited for pushing the boundaries of filmmaking despite
          its propagandistic nature, he criticized Indian propaganda films for
          prioritizing profit over artistic integrity. Notably, he cited The
          Kashmir Files, directed by Vivek Agnihotri, as a prime example of this
          phenomenon, citing its commercial success but criticizing its
          historical inaccuracies and sensationalist approach.

          During the 1980s, as the ghazal genre gained prominence in Indian
          music, a deeply moving poem depicting a father&apos;s emotions upon
          receiving a letter from home resonated profoundly with the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The song &quot;Chitthi aayi hai&quot; touched millions, particularly
          the diaspora, stirring tears with lines like &quot;You&apos;ve earned
          a lot of money, it made you leave your country&quot; and &quot;Leave
          this strange country and come back, break this cage, O bird, come
          back,&quot; evoking memories and longings for home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pankaj Udhas, who infused his soul into these lyrics penned by Anand
          Bakshi for Mahesh Bhatt&apos;s film &quot;Naam&quot; (1986), passed
          away at the age of 72 after battling pancreatic cancer for months at
          Mumbai&apos;s Breach Candy Hospital on Monday. He is survived by his
          older brothers Manhar and Nirmal, wife Farida, and daughters Nayaab
          and Rewa.

          &quot;With a heavy heart, we announce the sad demise of Padmashri
          Pankaj Udhas on 26th February 2024 due to a prolonged illness,&quot;
          wrote his daughter Nayaab in an Instagram post. The singer&apos;s last
          rites will be conducted on Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were among
          those mourning Udhas&apos;s death. Modi praised Udhas as a beacon of
          Indian music whose melodies transcended generations, acknowledging
          their interactions over the years and expressing condolences to his
          family and fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the emotional impact of &quot;Chitthi aayi hai,&quot; numerous
          stories emerged of people returning home from abroad or feeling a deep
          yearning to reunite with loved ones. This phenomenon propelled Udhas,
          despite his ordinary voice, to prominence in the ghazal world
          alongside stalwarts like Mehdi Hasan, Ghulam Ali, and Jagjit Singh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in 1951 in Jetpur, Gujarat, Udhas hailed from a family with a
          passion for music. His father, a farmer, played the dilruba and
          encouraged Udhas and his brothers to delve into music from a young
          age. Udhas initially learned tabla at the Sangeet Natya Akademi in
          Rajkot before gravitating towards vocal classical music under the
          guidance of Master Navrang Nagpurkar in Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          His exposure to ghazals during his time at St Xavier&apos;s sparked
          his interest in the genre, leading him to learn Urdu from a tutor and
          delve deeper into its intricacies. Despite facing challenges breaking
          into the playback singing scene dominated by established voices, Udhas
          persevered, driven by his love for ghazals and the receptive audience
          abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early 1980s, Udhas released notable ghazal albums like
          &quot;Aahat&quot; (1980) and &quot;Nayaab&quot; (1985), but it was
          &quot;Chitthi aayi hai&quot; that catapulted him to fame. Subsequent
          hits like &quot;Jeeye to jeeye kaise&quot; from &quot;Saajan&quot;
          (1991), &quot;Mohra&quot; (1994), and &quot;Chandi jaisa rang hai
          tera&quot; (2001) cemented his popularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Udhas&apos;s contributions extended beyond ghazals; he ventured into
          indie pop with songs like &quot;Ahista&quot; and founded the ghazal
          festival &quot;Khazana.&quot; Despite halting performances due to
          illness, his impact on Indian music remains indelible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Udhas&apos;s passing, the country mourns the loss of a voice that
          stirred countless emotions and left an enduring legacy in the world of
          music, as acknowledged by Yash Raj Films.
