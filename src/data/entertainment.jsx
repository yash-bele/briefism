          Filmmaker Rohit Shetty has recently disclosed how a stunt accident on
          the sets of his 2013 Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Chennai Express brought
          back traumatic memories of a fatal mishap under his late father MB
          Shetty&apos;s supervision in the 1980 film Bombay 405 Miles.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Bombay 405 Miles, featuring Shatrughan Sinha, MB Shetty was the
          action director. Sinha&apos;s body double Mansoor had to jump from a
          warehouse as part of a stunt sequence involving a huge blast.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an interview, Rohit Shetty recounted how during the shoot, due to
          chaos and confusion, the blast operator and camera operator had
          inadvertently switched positions unbeknownst to Shetty. So when
          Mansoor jumped, Shetty signaled the blast technician assuming he was
          the cameraman. The warehouse exploded with Mansoor inside, leading to
          his demise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty was a child then and only heard about the horrific accident in
          the evening. A year later, his father passed away as well, overcome by
          guilt over the incident. Though MB Shetty had a strong reputation
          among industry folks, this tragedy weighed heavily on him. He turned
          to alcoholism, withdrew from work and remained homebound before his
          death. The family understood his suffering led to his premature demise
          ‚Äì destiny&apos;s cruelty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shetty then described a controlled car blast scene in Chennai Express.
          Though his team removes fuel tanks for such stunts, some petrol had
          spilled on the chassis while prepping. Unbeknownst to them, the
          imported car had a reserve tank. After filming the scene, a spark
          reignited the splattered petrol, engulfing the car in flames with
          veteran stuntman Shankar Anna inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          They panicked as the flaming, overturned car trapped Shankar inside.
          Fortunately fire brigades on standby doused the flames, broke the
          glass and rescued him with minor burns. The chilling parallel to his
          father&apos;s long-ago accident shook Shetty deeply before he gathered
          himself and rushed Shankar to the hospital. He has fully recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interview, Shetty called his mother Ratna a &quot;fighter&quot;
          who raised him and his sister through immense hardship after his
          father&apos;s death. Despite struggles and poverty, she shielded them
          from sadness and nurtured a stoic work ethic. To support the family,
          she resumed stunt doubling for stars, having met MB Shetty through
          this work. If you notice the top-angle shots in Andaaz song Zindagi Ek
          Safar, Ratna is the one sitting there!
        </p>
        <p>
          After Shetty started working, Ratna stopped and their fortunes
          changed. But he inherited her grit to face challenges head-on. Shetty
          feels that as long as there is work, there is hope. He remains
          eternally grateful to his mother for shielding him throughout the
          decade-long adversity after his father&apos;s passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The director has now made his streaming debut with the Prime Video
          series Indian Police Force starring Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi
          and Shilpa Shetty.

          With his first foray into the OTT space, filmmaker Rohit Shetty brings
          his signature crash-bang formulaic cop drama to the streaming universe
          with &apos;Indian Police Force&apos;. Teaming up with co-director
          Sushwanth Prakash, Shetty packs the 7-episode show with the
          over-the-top tropes and tactics seen in his box office hit franchises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans of the director&apos;s &apos;Singham&apos; and &apos;Simmba&apos;
          films won&apos;t find surprises here. The series stays squarely in
          Shetty&apos;s wheelhouse, cramming in evil Muslim terrorists countered
          by valiant Muslim officers, contrived plots threatening innocents, and
          vehicles spinning wildly through the air. Romantic song interludes
          between the lead pair stretch the runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          References to his previous cop heroes Singham and Simmba reinforce
          we&apos;re in familiar territory, transplanted to Delhi though largely
          realized through obvious CGI landmarks. It&apos;s a greatest hits of
          elements from Shetty&apos;s cinematic cop sagas, now extended into an
          episodic streaming iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his heavy-hitter lead stars Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn and Ranveer
          Singh unavailable, Shetty casts Sidharth Malhotra, Vivek Oberoi and
          Shilpa Shetty as the khaki-clad officers. They sport the mandatory
          sculpted midriffs and tough guy Ray-Ban glares synonymous with the
          director&apos;s testosterone-fueled style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vivek Oberoi is compelling but underutilized as the washed-up
          inspector reinstated for one last case. Sidharth Malhotra&apos;s
          wide-eyed sincerity sits oddly with the brute force his character
          employs. But Shilpa Shetty seems to relish playing the badass officer
          known simply by her surname, getting in on the kicking and punching
          action. Here&apos;s hoping she sees more of that in a likely second
          season.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the freedom of streaming, Shetty delivers his signature bells and
          whistles without the price of a theater ticket. Logic, nuance and
          detail are beside the point in this turbo-charged spectacle. The
          director&apos;s steadfast formula marches on, now reaching fans&apos;
          screens at home.
        </p>
        <p>
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; relies on familiar devices like
          misdirection and sleight of hand rather than air-tight plotting to
          propel its thin story. The cast is decorative, tasked with modeling
          police apparel and dodging explosions rather than embodying
          characters. Fans seeking high-octane stunts and mindless entertainment
          will get their fill.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those expecting evolution or innovation in Shetty&apos;s
          storytelling may be disappointed. The show brings his high-decibel cop
          anthems to OTT largely unchanged. For devotees of the director&apos;s
          campy maximalism, it&apos;s a familiar fast food fix now delivered via
          streaming. With a captive audience at home, seasoning is optional when
          serving more of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The debut season amounts to an all-you-can-eat Rohit Shetty cop drama
          buffet. Logical restraint and nuance won&apos;t be on the menu. But
          stunts will be super-sized along with the pyrotechnics. So viewers
          craving adventures in Shetty&apos;s OTT universe can have their
          expectations met by this platter of the director&apos;s greatest hits.
          &apos;Indian Police Force&apos; offers a tried and tested sensory
          overload feast for fans seeking familiar flavor.

          Rumors of an engagement between Telugu film stars Vijay Deverakonda
          and Rashmika Mandanna have resurfaced, with some reports even
          speculating a February wedding. However, Vijay has categorically
          denied these latest rumors in a recent interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Addressing the claims, Vijay remarked, &quot;I&apos;m not getting
          engaged or married in February.&quot; He added, seemingly weary of the
          recurring speculation, &quot;It feels like the press just wants to get
          me married every two years. I hear this rumor every year.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vijay and Rashmika first sparked relationship speculation after
          starring together in the 2018 Telugu hit Geetha Govindam, later
          reteaming for the 2019 film Dear Comrade. While not publicly
          confirming their status, the two have been spotted together on
          multiple occasions over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last year, they were seen vacationing at a beach resort in the
          Maldives. More recently, the supposed couple was photographed
          holidaying in Vietnam, fueling rumors they are now living together and
          may formalize their relationship soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professionally, both actors have been riding high. Rashmika is basking
          in the success of Animal with Ranbir Kapoor, and will next be seen in
          the eagerly awaited sequel Pushpa 2: The Rule alongside Allu Arjun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Vijay starred opposite Samantha Ruth Prabhu in this
          year&apos;s Tamil rom-com Khushi. He has the upcoming Telugu films
          Family Star and VD12 with director Gowtam Tinnanuri in the pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          So while their admirers may be willing it, Vijay has quashed the
          latest gossip about an engagement or wedding with Rashmika. However,
          the tight-lipped co-stars continue to remain coy about the true nature
          of their bond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time will tell whether the patterns of the past repeat, with more
          joint vacations and sightings further fueling rumors of romance. For
          now though, Vijay asserts the February wedding chatter holds no water.

          Orry, the internet personality, is the modern day equivalent of Oscar
          Wilde - an unconventional free spirit who refuses to bow to societal
          pressures and norms. His recent conversation with Karan Johar evoked
          parallels to Wilde&apos;s controversial trial for homosexuality in
          1895.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Wilde, Orry represents a bold rejection of convention and an
          unapologetic commitment to self-expression. Where Wilde faced
          hostility for his sexuality and bohemian lifestyle in Victorian
          England, Orry draws ire today for shunning expectations of how
          celebrities should behave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both serve as a mirror that reflects the discomfiting truths about
          societal prejudice. Their disregard for norms enrages the
          &apos;incalculably stupid brutes and illiterates&apos; unable to
          appreciate their artistry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wilde was prosecuted by the Marquess of Queensberry, who abhorred the
          playwright&apos;s affairs with his son. Despite friends counseling
          prudence, an indignant Wilde sued the Marquess for libel over a note
          calling him a &quot;posing sodomite.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What followed was a ruthless trial by media aiming to prove
          Wilde&apos;s homosexuality. His Dublin acquaintance Edward Carson
          ruthlessly cross-examined him, despising Wilde for consorting with
          lower classes. When asked about the morality of art, Wilde famously
          replied works of art are simply good or bad, not moral or immoral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, those mocking Orry fail to recognize art and thought when
          confronted by it. Like Wilde, Orry lives in &apos;incalculably stupid
          times&apos; too blinkered to appreciate true originality.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Bertrand Russell noted, conventional minds rage at nonconformity
          because they see it as criticism of themselves. Orry draws ire for not
          obeying the usual star rules. Unlike nepotistic actors ruining
          classics, he embraces life as his own film, liberated from PR diktats.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spurns industry rituals and misogynistic tropes masquerading as
          cinema. Unlike reclusive creators like Harper Lee, Orry actively
          engages the world on his own terms. His autonomy threatens
          establishments invested in compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The philosopher Ramadhir Singh observed people inhabit personal dream
          worlds. Orry has transcended this limitation to seamlessly merge his
          inner life and outward persona. His self-actualization elicits anger
          from those unable to achieve this liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Wilde, Orry represents the timeless struggle between convention
          and creativity, tradition and novelty, repression and rebellion. Both
          expose society&apos;s tendency to vilify nonconformists exposing
          suppressed truths. They pay a price for providing that mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          But visionaries who reject the familiar for fresh horizons often must
          withstand hostility from blinkered minds. Art that challenges
          orthodoxies inevitably provokes backlash. However, daring spirits like
          Orry and Wilde also open the door to progress and new possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though differing in context, Orry and Wilde&apos;s journeys highlight
          the burdens born by those rejecting the beaten path. Convention exerts
          a powerful pull that visionaries must overcome. Both inspire kindred
          spirits to live courageously, even if it draws ridicule from the
          &apos;incalculably stupid&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          By boldly pursuing self-expression over conformity, they light the way
          for future generations to actualize their inner cinema, unencumbered
          by others‚Äô limited perceptions. Orry, like Wilde, represents the
          eternally alluring promise of fearlessly being oneself.

          The new Netflix true crime documentary American Nightmare transcends
          the usual reductive tropes of the genre to deliver a piercing critique
          of flawed policing, everyday sexism, and ultimately, a moving love
          story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Created by the talented team behind The Tinder Swindler, American
          Nightmare revisits a brief media frenzy from 2015 that drew
          comparisons to Gone Girl. Young blonde woman Denise Huskins was
          reported missing by her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, who claimed they were
          attacked by masked intruders who kidnapped Denise after binding and
          sedating him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cops immediately suspected Aaron was lying. Why would anyone
          kidnap Denise? Why demand a measly $15,000 ransom? And didn&apos;t
          Aaron confess to emotionally cheating on Denise because he wanted his
          ex back? Sensing Gone Girl vibes, the police zeroed in on Aaron as the
          prime suspect, threatening to label him a &quot;monster.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          The case exploded when Denise suddenly reappeared at her family home
          48 hours after vanishing, traumatized and needing time to process her
          ordeal before talking to police. But the cops refused, convinced this
          was an elaborate hoax. Mere hours after Denise&apos;s return, they
          held a press conference accusing her of wasting resources on a wild
          goose chase.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare intricately recounts events through extensive
          interviews with Aaron and Denise, interrogation footage, lawyer
          inputs, and a journalist who covered the saga. The filmmakers
          skillfully cherry pick key moments to spin an engaging story while
          assuming viewer unfamiliarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the most impressive aspect is the even-handed tone taken on this
          complex case. The procedural route or salacious angle were obvious
          options passed over. Instead, American Nightmare is a remarkably
          level-headed exploration of a real-life tragedy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s astonishing how gracefully Denise and Aaron handled the
          media maelstrom. The show calls out prejudiced press coverage and a
          gullible public ever-eager to anoint new villains just to feel morally
          superior. Even Gone Girl&apos;s Amazing Amy didn&apos;t suffer this
          degree of indignity, and she was an actual criminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the investigation proceeds, the couple&apos;s version of events
          checks out. The meticulous methodology and odd ransom demand point to
          a sophisticated extortion ring later uncovered. But the damage was
          done. Aaron&apos;s reputation and career were left in tatters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through extensive interviews, Denise and Aaron&apos;s incredible bond
          emerges, stronger than ever. We learn of Aaron&apos;s protective
          nature, traced back to his firefighter father&apos;s emphasis on
          serving others. Despite law enforcement&apos;s betrayal, the couple
          displays uncommon grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviews with willful investigators unwilling to admit mistakes
          reveal deep systemic flaws in policing - confirmation bias, sloppy
          detection, and macho posturing supersede the truth. The press comes
          off even worse, salivating for a juicy &apos;he did it&apos; plot
          instead of waiting for facts.
        </p>
        <p>
          American Nightmare ultimately transcends genre by training its focus
          on flawed institutions and everyday misogyny rather than
          sensationalism. An impeccably crafted, morally grounded piece, it
          serves as an inspiring example of two ordinary people displayed
          uncommon courage under fire.

          Talented actor Bhumi Pednekar is set to deliver another powerful
          performance in the upcoming Netflix investigative drama Bhakshak.
          Produced by Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan&apos;s renowned production
          house Red Chillies Entertainment, the highly anticipated film is
          slated for release on Netflix on February 9th.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhumi unveiled the intense teaser on social media, describing it as
          the story of a committed journalist who perseveres to uncover the
          truth no matter what. Bhakshak is inspired by real life events that
          took place in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teaser provides a glimpse of Bhumi portraying the role of Vaishali
          Singh, a determined investigative journalist seeking to expose a
          horrific crime and shed light on the dismal reality of violence
          against women in society. Commenting on the film&apos;s hard-hitting
          theme, the director expressed that the aim is to highlight difficult
          realities and generate meaningful conversations that can lead to
          positive change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gaurav Verma, producer at Red Chillies Entertainment, conveyed that
          they believe in storytelling that not only engages audiences but also
          enlightens them. He described Bhakshak as a testimony to their
          commitment to thought-provoking narratives that encourage social
          reflections. They are excited to partner with Netflix to share this
          impactful story with global audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruchikaa Kapoor Sheikh from Netflix India added that Bhakshak is an
          intense story following a resolute journalist&apos;s unfaltering
          pursuit of justice against all obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helmed by director Pulkit, Bhakshak also features impressive
          performances by Sanjay Mishra, Aditya Srivastava and Sai Tamhankar
          essaying pivotal roles. But Bhumi takes centerstage in her portrayal
          of the fierce journalist at the heart of this hard-hitting story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set to premiere exclusively on Netflix on February 9th, the promising
          investigative drama marks another career defining performance by Bhumi
          Pednekar in the central role.
