          Sharad Kelkar, one of the most recognizable voices in Bollywood,
          recently discussed his experiences dubbing for South Indian films. He
          is known for voicing Prabhas&apos; characters in the Hindi dubbed
          versions of films like Baahubali and Salaar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar shared that he used to stammer as a child and never imagined he
          would become an actor or voice actor. On dubbing for South films, he
          said the recognition he got for voicing Prabhas was immense, unlike
          anything seen before in the voicing industry. He noted how audiences
          now notice the voice artists, like Shreyas Talpade in Pushpa and
          Sachin Gole for Yash in KGF.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Kelkar, Baahubali brought about this change and made
          people recognize and respect voice actors. He wants filmmakers to
          start crediting voice actors in movie posters and end credits, like
          it&apos;s done in Hollywood animated films. He feels voice actors in
          India don&apos;t get their due.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussing overcoming his stammering, Kelkar shared that correcting
          his breathing pattern helped stop his stammering. People started
          noticing his voice after that. To improve his voice modulation, he
          observed other actors&apos; dialogue delivery. Once the stammering
          reduced, he learned the craft of dubbing from coach Mona Shetty.
          Starting with small projects, his big break was Baahubali.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kelkar&apos;s next voice acting project is Hotstar&apos;s animated
          series The Legend of Hanuman, where he has voiced Ravana. He chooses
          projects based on the writing. He wanted to break the cliche and
          present a new perspective on Ravana. As an actor, voicing mythological
          characters allows exploring them in new ways. Overall, Kelkar wants
          writers to get more recognition in India for their critical
          contribution.

          Mahesh Babu’s highly anticipated return to screens after two years in
          the Trivikram Srinivas-directorial ‘SSMB28’, titled ‘Guntur Kaaram’,
          has received a roaring response on its opening day. According to early
          estimates by trade website Sacnilk, the film has collected a gross of
          Rs 50 crore on day one, reflecting Mahesh Babu’s star power.
        </p>
        <p>
          As expected, the lion’s share of the collection for ‘Guntur Kaaram’
          came from the Telugu superstar’s stronghold of Andhra Pradesh and
          Telangana. The estimated gross from the Telugu territories was
          approximately Rs 44.5 crore. This was followed by Karnataka with Rs
          4.5 crore gross, Tamil Nadu with Rs 0.5 crore and Rs 0.5 crore from
          other parts of India.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other major release this Friday was Teja Sajja and director
          Prasanth Varma’s pan-India sci-fi fantasy ‘HanuMan’. Despite positive
          reviews, the film had a more subdued opening day compared to ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’. The total day one net collection for ‘HanuMan’ across all
          languages was Rs 7.56 crore as per estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of this, the majority Rs 5.5 crore net came from the Telugu version.
          The Hindi dubbed version contributed Rs 2 crore, while other languages
          chipped in with Rs 0.06 crore. However, the unique genre and
          word-of-mouth are expected to attract the family audience, especially
          in the Hindi belt where there is a dearth of major releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first weekend remains crucial for both ‘Guntur Kaaram’ and
          ‘HanuMan’ as the Sankranti weekend will see other big Telugu releases
          like Venkatesh’s ‘Saindhav’ and Nagarjuna’s ‘NaanSamruddha’ competing
          for screens and audiences. Trade pundits had predicted Mahesh Babu’s
          film will dominate over the Sankranti releases due to his stardom. It
          remains to be seen if the box office dynamics change as more films
          open.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Trivikram Srinivas, known for several blockbusters, ‘Guntur
          Kaaram’ marks an attempt to deliver a hit after his previous film ‘Ala
          Vaikunthapurramuloo’. Mahesh Babu was last seen in the 2020
          blockbuster ‘Sarileru Neekevvaru’. Hence, the combination of the star
          actor and popular director has generated immense buzz among fans.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Guntur Kaaram’ features Mahesh Babu in the role of an archaeologist
          on a treasure hunt. Pooja Hegde stars as the female lead, while the
          cast includes Jayaram, Sachin Khedekar, and others. The story blends
          comedy, adventure, and supernatural elements against the backdrop of
          Guntur.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film’s release in theaters coinciding with the Sankranti festival
          weekend gives it the advantage of attracting big crowds. Moreover,
          Mahesh Babu has a huge fan following across the Telugu states who
          eagerly await his films on the big screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Covid pandemic impacting the entertainment industry over the
          past two years, the response to ‘Guntur Kaaram’ indicates that
          audiences are flocking back to theaters when major stars like Mahesh
          Babu deliver a promising film.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the film sustains its collections over the extended opening week
          and positive word-of-mouth, it is headed towards becoming a huge hit.
          Not just in the Telugu belt, but even markets like Karnataka, Tamil
          Nadu, and Hindi circuits hold potential if content clicks with a wide
          appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Telugu film industry, the success of ‘Guntur Kaaram’ will
          provide a major boost after a difficult pandemic period. And for
          Mahesh Babu, it will cement his standing as one of Tollywood’s most
          bankable superstars with an enviable box office track record.
