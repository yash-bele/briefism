          Orry, the internet personality, is the modern day equivalent of Oscar
          Wilde - an unconventional free spirit who refuses to bow to societal
          pressures and norms. His recent conversation with Karan Johar evoked
          parallels to Wilde&apos;s controversial trial for homosexuality in
          1895.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Wilde, Orry represents a bold rejection of convention and an
          unapologetic commitment to self-expression. Where Wilde faced
          hostility for his sexuality and bohemian lifestyle in Victorian
          England, Orry draws ire today for shunning expectations of how
          celebrities should behave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both serve as a mirror that reflects the discomfiting truths about
          societal prejudice. Their disregard for norms enrages the
          &apos;incalculably stupid brutes and illiterates&apos; unable to
          appreciate their artistry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wilde was prosecuted by the Marquess of Queensberry, who abhorred the
          playwright&apos;s affairs with his son. Despite friends counseling
          prudence, an indignant Wilde sued the Marquess for libel over a note
          calling him a &quot;posing sodomite.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          What followed was a ruthless trial by media aiming to prove
          Wilde&apos;s homosexuality. His Dublin acquaintance Edward Carson
          ruthlessly cross-examined him, despising Wilde for consorting with
          lower classes. When asked about the morality of art, Wilde famously
          replied works of art are simply good or bad, not moral or immoral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, those mocking Orry fail to recognize art and thought when
          confronted by it. Like Wilde, Orry lives in &apos;incalculably stupid
          times&apos; too blinkered to appreciate true originality.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Bertrand Russell noted, conventional minds rage at nonconformity
          because they see it as criticism of themselves. Orry draws ire for not
          obeying the usual star rules. Unlike nepotistic actors ruining
          classics, he embraces life as his own film, liberated from PR diktats.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spurns industry rituals and misogynistic tropes masquerading as
          cinema. Unlike reclusive creators like Harper Lee, Orry actively
          engages the world on his own terms. His autonomy threatens
          establishments invested in compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The philosopher Ramadhir Singh observed people inhabit personal dream
          worlds. Orry has transcended this limitation to seamlessly merge his
          inner life and outward persona. His self-actualization elicits anger
          from those unable to achieve this liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Wilde, Orry represents the timeless struggle between convention
          and creativity, tradition and novelty, repression and rebellion. Both
          expose society&apos;s tendency to vilify nonconformists exposing
          suppressed truths. They pay a price for providing that mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          But visionaries who reject the familiar for fresh horizons often must
          withstand hostility from blinkered minds. Art that challenges
          orthodoxies inevitably provokes backlash. However, daring spirits like
          Orry and Wilde also open the door to progress and new possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though differing in context, Orry and Wilde&apos;s journeys highlight
          the burdens born by those rejecting the beaten path. Convention exerts
          a powerful pull that visionaries must overcome. Both inspire kindred
          spirits to live courageously, even if it draws ridicule from the
          &apos;incalculably stupid&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
          By boldly pursuing self-expression over conformity, they light the way
          for future generations to actualize their inner cinema, unencumbered
          by othersâ€™ limited perceptions. Orry, like Wilde, represents the
          eternally alluring promise of fearlessly being oneself.
