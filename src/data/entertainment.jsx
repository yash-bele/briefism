          The latest season of Shark Tank India has sparked discussions among
          viewers, particularly drawing attention to one of the new
          &quot;sharks,&quot; Deepinder Goyal, the founder of Zomato. A video
          clip has been circulating, showcasing Goyal providing feedback to the
          team from WTF Fitness during their pitch, and it has led to
          comparisons with the previous judge, Ashneer Grover.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the promotional video, Goyal can be seen critiquing the WTF Fitness
          team for their lack of attention to detail in presenting their
          business idea. He pointed out various mistakes in their pitch,
          emphasizing the importance of paying attention to details and showing
          respect to customers and partners. Goyal questioned why the phone
          number mentioned had nine digits instead of the standard ten and
          highlighted a grammatical error in the phrase &quot;India’s
          Most.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Why does the &apos;M&apos; in &apos;Most&apos; have a capital
          letter? You are incorporating grammar into the AI model?&quot; Goyal
          remarked. He further expressed his disappointment, stating, &quot;This
          is your showcase; you are appearing on TV. Don’t you love your brand
          enough? Show some love and respect to your customers. If there is a
          typo in a CV, it gets swiped left in less than two seconds. Why did
          you get more than two seconds? It is because you are on national
          television.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Fans of the show praised the latest episode, with some expressing that
          it was an improvement over the previous one. One viewer mentioned,
          &quot;A breath of fresh air in a dying show without Piyush &
          Ashneer.&quot; Another fan commented, &quot;Ashneer has said he
          learned business from Deepinder. Now, we can see for ourselves what
          effect he has had on Ashneer.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ashneer Grover was a popular judge in the first season of Shark Tank
          India. However, due to issues with his former company BharatPe, a
          fintech firm he co-founded, he did not continue as a judge in
          subsequent seasons. The current season features other judges,
          including Anupam Mittal, Namita Thapar, Vineeta Singh, Aman Gupta, and
          Riteish Agarwal, among others.

          The first teaser of the supernatural thriller &quot;Shaitaan,&quot;
          featuring Ajay Devgn, Jyotika, and R Madhavan, was unveiled by the
          film&apos;s makers. Directed by Vikas Bahl, the movie is scheduled to
          hit theaters on March 8.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teaser of &quot;Shaitaan&quot; commences with an eerie narration
          proclaiming, &quot;They say the world is deaf, yet they listen to
          every word of mine. I am darkness. I am the bowl of temptation.&quot;
          As the voice, describing itself as the &quot;owner of nine
          hells,&quot; &quot;night,&quot; &quot;twilight,&quot; and
          &quot;curse,&quot; continues, the background score intensifies. The
          teaser alludes to the film&apos;s dark and spooky elements but
          refrains from revealing anything about the plot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Towards the end, the voice introduces a game, offering a glimpse of a
          frightened Ajay Devgn and Jyotika, alongside a black voodoo doll.
          Madhavan&apos;s wicked laughter at the conclusion adds an eerie touch.
          The teaser comes with the caption, &quot;Woh poochega tumse… ek khel
          hai, kheloge? Par uske behkaave mein mat aana! (He will ask you to
          play a game, but don’t get tempted).&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ajay Devgn had announced &quot;Shaitaan&quot; a week earlier. The
          film, presented by Jio Studios, Devgn Films, and Panorama Studios, is
          produced by Ajay Devgn, Jyoti Deshpande, Kumar Mangat Pathak, and
          Abhishek Pathak. Notably, the film marks Jyothika&apos;s return to
          Hindi cinema after almost 25 years. She initiated her acting career
          with the 1997 Hindi film &quot;Doli Saja Ke Rakhna&quot; and later
          starred in the 2001 Bollywood drama &quot;Little John.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Before unveiling the teaser, Ajay Devgn shared the first look poster
          of &quot;Shaitaan,&quot; featuring himself, Jyotika, and Madhavan.
          While Devgn and Jyothika appear frightened, Madhavan sports a devilish
          smile. Devgn wrote, &quot;#Shaitaan is coming to cast a spell on
          you,&quot; along with the poster. Madhavan added, &quot;#Shaitaan
          nazar milata nahi – nazar lagata hai. (The devil doesn’t look at you,
          he aims at you.)&quot; and Jyotika remarked, &quot;#Shaitaan ka bura
          saaya kabhi bata kar nahin aata. (The devil comes unannounced).&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to &quot;Shaitaan,&quot; Ajay Devgn is set to appear in
          Rohit Shetty’s &quot;Singham Again&quot; and Amit Sharma’s
          &quot;Maidaan&quot; later this year.

          Hrithik Roshan is pinning his hopes on &quot;Fighter,&quot; a
          high-budget aerial action film directed by Siddharth Anand, to reclaim
          lost momentum at the box office. The movie, also featuring Anil Kapoor
          and Deepika Padukone, hit theaters on January 25, just ahead of the
          Republic Day holiday weekend. According to industry tracker Sacnilk,
          &quot;Fighter&quot; is anticipated to rake in Rs 25 crore on its
          opening day. While this would be considered one of Hrithik&apos;s top
          debuts, it falls short of the record set by his biggest hit, Siddharth
          Anand&apos;s &quot;War,&quot; which made double that amount on its
          first day at the same time last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Directed by Siddharth, &quot;Fighter&quot; managed to secure over Rs
          8.4 crore in advance ticket sales prior to its release and is reported
          to have been produced with a budget of Rs 250 crore. Hrithik and
          Siddharth have previously collaborated on successful projects such as
          &quot;Bang Bang!&quot; and &quot;War,&quot; both of which delivered
          Hrithik&apos;s top debuts. &quot;Fighter&quot; has the potential to
          join this list, with box office earnings expected to surge on Republic
          Day, a national holiday falling on Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, &quot;Bang Bang!&quot; achieved an opening day collection of
          Rs 27 crore, while &quot;War&quot; set a new record with Rs 53 crore
          on its first day, a record that has since been surpassed. If
          &quot;Fighter&quot; manages to exceed the Rs 25.5 crore opening of
          &quot;Krrish 3&quot; from a decade ago by just Rs 50 lakh, it will
          secure the position as Hrithik&apos;s third-highest debut.
          Siddharth&apos;s personal best remains &quot;Pathaan,&quot; which
          earned Rs 57 crore on its opening day around the same time last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the blockbuster success of &quot;War&quot; in 2019, Hrithik has
          appeared in only one film, &quot;Vikram Vedha,&quot; a gangster drama
          co-starring Saif Ali Khan. Despite being considered an under-performer
          with earnings below Rs 80 crore in India, Hrithik&apos;s star power in
          the pre-pandemic era helped films like &quot;Super 30&quot; and
          &quot;Kaabil&quot; cross the coveted Rs 100 crore mark domestically.

          Renowned musician Rahat Fateh Ali Khan recently held a press
          conference to announce a change in his management, handing over the
          reins to his wife, Nida Rahat, and other family members. This decision
          marks a departure from his previous management led by music and
          concert producer Salman Ahmed. Khan shared this update on social
          media, urging clients not to make payments to his former management.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video of the press conference shared on social media, Khan
          stated, “RFAK (his music company in Pakistan) is merging with NRK,
          whose president is my wife and her brother Mohd Baqa Niazi, who is in
          New Jersey. My brothers Ashar Anwar, Maroof Ali Khan, and Raja Umair
          Hussain are working with me locally in Pakistan. We have parted ways
          with our previous management in a peaceful and lovely way.”
        </p>
        <p>
          However, alongside this announcement, the music maestro cautioned his
          clients against making payments to his previous management. He
          emphasized, “I will request our clients not to make any payments to
          our previous management. I would like them to make payments only if
          they have my signature on the receiving end. Earlier, I didn’t pay
          attention to these things, and a lot of clients, who were associated
          with me because of their love for me, have been trapped because of
          these payments. Such episodes should not be repeated, and this is one
          of the main reasons that I have conducted this press conference.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Salman Ahmed, who managed Rahat Fateh Ali Khan for the past 12 years,
          responded to the singer&apos;s allegations, dismissing them as false.
          He asserted that he has documentation for all transactions and is
          prepared to present it to Pakistan’s Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR)
          and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
        </p>
        <p>
          Ahmed stated, “Only 5 days before the press conference, the maestro
          had asked me to meet him and finalize his UK tour and other dates
          which he had committed with me.” He went on to claim that over the
          past decade, he handled not only Khan’s business affairs, managing
          three marriages and children, but also served as a protective shield.
          Ahmed expressed disappointment in the baseless allegations and
          emphasized that Rahat Fateh Ali Khan undervalued his sincerity. He
          concluded, “It is show time now. The world will see the reality.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Before gaining international acclaim, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan was a
          prominent singer in Pakistan. He has lent his voice to numerous Hindi
          film songs, including &quot;O Re Piya&quot; (Aaja Nachle), &quot;Teri
          Ore&quot; (Singh Is Kinng), &quot;Dil Toh Bachcha Hai Ji&quot;
          (Ishqiya), &quot;Sanu Ek Pal Chain&quot; (Raid), and many others.

          Amitabh Bachchan, renowned for his distinctive baritone, presented an
          unexpected challenge for director Sanjay Gupta during the production
          of the film Kaante. In a recent interview, Gupta disclosed that Kaante
          marked a significant departure for Bachchan as it was likely his first
          film shot entirely in sync sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          During a conversation with Siddharth Kannan, Sanjay reminisced,
          &quot;I remember when I started shooting for Kaante… Kaante was
          sync-sound, and everybody had to be in their natural space. And I
          don’t think Amit ji had ever done anything in sync-sound before
          that.&quot; He recounted a specific rehearsal for a scene involving
          Big B, Suniel Shetty, and Kumar Gaurav, where everyone, excluding
          Amitabh, was instructed to speak in their normal, conversational tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the rehearsal, Sanjay Gupta and Sanjay Dutt shared a knowing
          look, acknowledging the need to address Amitabh Bachchan&apos;s unique
          vocal style. &quot;When the rehearsal happened, me and Sanju exchanged
          looks and I was thinking, now who bells the cat?&quot; Gupta
          humorously recalled. The decision was made to approach Bachchan and
          delicately suggest modifying his vocal delivery to better align with
          the sync sound requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a one-on-one discussion with Bachchan, Gupta conveyed the
          intricacies of sync sound and the impact of vocal delivery on the
          overall audio dynamics of the film. &quot;I remember I sat down with
          him. I said ‘Sir, I just wanted to tell you something. I just heard
          the recording…’ I hadn’t listened to anything by then. I told him that
          his voice was getting distorted, so he had to (gestures to lower it
          down) because the rest of them are speaking softly. He asked ‘you want
          me to take it softer?’ I said ‘yes, more natural.’ He gave me that
          look ‘what do you mean more natural?’ But after that, everything was a
          piece of cake,&quot; Gupta shared, emphasizing the collaborative and
          adaptable nature of the interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          This candid exchange highlighted the importance of effective
          communication between a director and actor in navigating challenges
          during the filmmaking process. The adjustment made during that
          discussion allowed for a more harmonious blending of voices in sync
          sound, ultimately enhancing the overall cinematic experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the same interview, Gupta offered insights into the early planning
          stages of Kaante. Initially conceived as a film featuring newcomers,
          the creative direction took a turn after discussions with Sanjay Dutt.
          Dutt&apos;s encouragement led Gupta to envision Kaante as a
          large-scale cinematic endeavor, departing from the initial plan. The
          film drew significant inspiration from Quentin Tarantino&apos;s iconic
          work, &quot;Reservoir Dogs.&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          Released in 2002, Kaante presented a narrative revolving around a
          group of convicts planning a major heist, exploring themes of loyalty,
          betrayal, and camaraderie. The film&apos;s ensemble cast, including
          Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Suniel Shetty, Kumar Gaurav, Lucky Ali,
          and Mahesh Manjrekar, delivered impactful performances that resonated
          with the audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the initial challenge posed by the shift to sync sound and the
          need for adjustments in Bachchan&apos;s vocal delivery, Kaante emerged
          as a unique cinematic offering that seamlessly blended action, drama,
          and heist elements. The collaborative efforts of the cast and crew,
          coupled with Gupta&apos;s visionary direction, resulted in a film that
          left an indelible mark on Bollywood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kaante experience serves as a testament to the adaptive skills of
          seasoned actors like Amitabh Bachchan and the collaborative spirit
          within the film industry. It underscores the commitment to delivering
          authentic performances and the willingness to embrace new techniques
          for the betterment of the cinematic craft. As Bachchan&apos;s baritone
          adapted to the nuances of sync sound, it added another layer to his
          illustrious career, showcasing his versatility and dedication to his
          craft.

          Sanjay Gupta, known for directing films like Kaante, Jazbaa, and
          Kaabil, recently lent his support to director Sandeep Reddy Vanga amid
          the controversy surrounding his film, Animal. Sanjay commended
          Sandeep&apos;s conviction, noting that he has successfully unsettled
          many, contributing to the film&apos;s impact. Additionally, Sanjay
          expressed reservations about Javed Akhtar&apos;s criticism of Animal,
          suggesting that the veteran screenwriter views the world through a
          lens of nostalgia and is resistant to acknowledging societal changes.
        </p>

          During a conversation with Siddharth Kannan on his YouTube channel,
          Sanjay praised Sandeep for disrupting the conventional narrative.
          &quot;He has made a lot of people very uncomfortable. We are the land
          of the Kamasutra and Khajuraho, and we still don&apos;t talk about sex
          education. We are inherently a hypocritical race,&quot; Sanjay
          remarked. He discussed a recent meeting with Anurag Kashyap and
          Vikramaditya Motwane, where they acknowledged that Animal had
          significantly impacted the film industry. &quot;Recently, I had gone
          for the trial of a film and there I met Anurag Kashyap, Vikramaditya
          Motwane, and a few others. Animal is all anyone can talk about right
          now. Now life is pre and post Animal,&quot; he said. Sanjay also
          mentioned that his upcoming script has been influenced by Animal,
          thinking about what Sandeep Vanga would do in certain scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sanjay revealed that there were sequences in Animal reminiscent of his
          film Zinda, released in 2006 and starring Sanjay Dutt and John
          Abraham. Zinda, an unofficial adaptation of Oldboy, featured scenes
          similar to those found in Animal, specifically involving a hammer and
          a large-scale fight. &quot;There are sequences in Animal which we have
          shot in Zinda, almost 20 years ago in 2004. The exact same sequences,
          with the hammer and 30 people fighting,&quot; Sanjay disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding Javed Akhtar&apos;s criticism of Animal, Sanjay acknowledged
          that Javed might have a point but argued that he is viewing the world
          through &quot;rose-tinted glasses.&quot; According to Sanjay, Javed is
          reluctant to accept that society has evolved. &quot;He is not
          accepting that the society has already changed. We are not the same
          people we were 10 years ago. We don&apos;t have the same compassion.
          We don&apos;t have the same patience,&quot; Sanjay remarked. He
          pointed out the media manipulation and societal changes, emphasizing
          that blaming the film for societal issues or vice versa is not
          justified. At the 9th Ajanta-Ellora International Film Festival, Javed
          Akhtar had labeled Animal as &quot;dangerous&quot; and criticized its
          content.

        <p>
          Sanjay also expressed support for Anurag Kashyap, who defended Sandeep
          Reddy Vanga publicly. &quot;Anurag is defending Vanga, and he is very
          right. He is saying criticize the film, not the filmmaker. In Animal,
          people have a problem with Sandeep Vanga,&quot; Sanjay said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite facing criticism for its violent and misogynistic content,
          Animal managed to surpass Rs 900 crore at the worldwide box office.
          The film&apos;s success highlighted the audience&apos;s willingness to
          engage with unconventional narratives.
