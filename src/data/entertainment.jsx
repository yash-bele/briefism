          Actress Kriti Sanon, known for her recent roles in &quot;Crew&quot;
          and &quot;Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya,&quot; emphasized the
          importance of genuine support within the film industry. Rather than
          superficial compliments, she advocated for sincere encouragement and
          solidarity among colleagues. In a conversation with Zoom TV, Kriti
          expressed her belief that true unity and support would foster a more
          positive and successful environment. She noted a gradual shift in
          attitudes but highlighted the need for authentic camaraderie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kriti underscored the significance of acknowledging and praising
          impactful work, stating that such validation is crucial for actors.
          Addressing the prevalent sexist narrative attributing a film&apos;s
          failure to its female lead, she rejected the notion that success or
          failure rests solely on one individual. Dismissing hurtful comments,
          Kriti emphasized the collaborative nature of filmmaking, asserting
          that her focus remains on her craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the film industry, Kriti acknowledged similar sexist narratives
          in sports, where women are often unfairly blamed for failures. Despite
          facing online criticism, she advocated for resilience and urged
          against giving undue attention to trolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, Kriti disclosed her involvement in the upcoming project
          &quot;Do Patti,&quot; alongside Kajol, showcasing her ongoing
          commitment to her craft.

          Renowned actor Ranjeet, celebrated for his portrayal of antagonists in
          films, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s, recently disclosed in
          an interview that despite often portraying characters depicted as
          drinkers and smokers on screen, he has never consumed alcohol in his
          life. Despite his abstinent lifestyle, Ranjeet revealed that he
          frequently hosted gatherings for his colleagues in the film industry,
          showcasing his hospitality and social nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking with ANI, Ranjeet shared insights into the vibrant social
          scene at his residence in Juhu, where industry luminaries would
          convene regularly. He emphasized that his home became a hub for both
          male and female actors, fostering a relaxed and welcoming ambiance.
          Various stars, including Reena Roy, Parveen Babi, Moushumi Chatterjee,
          and Neetu Kapoor, contributed to the festivities by preparing dishes
          ranging from paranthas to fish and bhindi.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Ranjeet, the gatherings attracted a plethora of renowned
          personalities, with the likes of Sunil Dutt, Raaj Kumar, Sanjay Khan,
          Feroz Khan, Dharmendra, and Shatrughan Sinha frequenting his abode.
          Ranjeet recalled Rajesh Khanna&apos;s penchant for consuming one to
          two bottles of alcohol during these gatherings, illustrating the
          conviviality of the era.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his busy schedule, Ranjeet made it a point to accommodate his
          guests, recognizing the blessings associated with hosting visitors. He
          credited his spacious residence and ample staff for facilitating these
          gatherings, which often lasted well into the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the practicalities of such indulgent gatherings, Ranjeet
          explained that many actors, including the leading stars, would
          commence their workday later due to the late-night revelries. This
          delayed start allowed them to recuperate from the previous
          night&apos;s festivities before embarking on their professional
          commitments, a practice that Ranjeet himself adapted to maintain
          productivity amidst his hectic filming schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ranjeet&apos;s illustrious career includes memorable performances in
          iconic films such as &quot;Dharmatama,&quot; &quot;Namak Halaal,&quot;
          &quot;Sharaabi,&quot; and &quot;Lawaris,&quot; among numerous others.
          His recent revelations provide a fascinating glimpse into the social
          dynamics and lifestyle of Bollywood during its golden era.

        <p>
          In this poignant cinematic exploration, the central theme revolves
          around the interplay of love and pain. The narrative delves into the
          life of Adam (portrayed by Scott), a middle-aged man grappling with
          childhood loss, coinciding with the arrival of an unexpected
          connection that transcends conventional relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adam&apos;s identity as a gay man adds a nuanced layer to his yearning
          for a family that eluded him in his formative years. Drawing
          inspiration from a loosely based novel centered on a divorced man and
          his neighbor forging a friendship, the film captures the essence of
          human connection amid the solitude of a modern metropolis,
          specifically set in London.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative unfolds within the confines of a desolate high-rise,
          symbolizing the emotional isolation of its inhabitants. Adam&apos;s
          sole companion in this urban solitude is Harry (played by Mescal), an
          individual perpetually in a state of mild intoxication. Their paths
          intertwine one night when a false fire alarm leads Harry to
          Adam&apos;s doorstep, initiating an unexpected camaraderie sealed with
          a handshake that subtly acknowledges their shared identity as queer
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amidst Adam&apos;s struggle to pen an autobiographical script, a box
          of childhood photographs prompts a journey back to his London suburban
          home. To his astonishment, he encounters his parents, portrayed by
          Bell and Foy, alive and well at the age when they passed away, leaving
          Adam at the tender age of 12.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ensuing dialogues, tender and sincere, explore the dynamics
          between parent and child, unveiling concealed aspects of their
          relationships. Foy skillfully portrays Adam&apos;s mother, expressing
          both surprise and innocence as she grapples with the contemporary
          understanding of her son&apos;s sexuality. The father, played with
          depth, admits his suspicions about Adam&apos;s orientation but
          confesses to avoiding the topic for the sake of comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          A poignant moment arises when Adam revisits the night etched in his
          memory as the last night spent with his parents. His adult self,
          symbolically placed between them in bed, shares dreams of a life that
          could have been‚Äîa family trip to Disneyland, constant rain, and the
          inevitable familial disagreements. The scene encapsulates the essence
          of missed opportunities and unspoken sentiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the trio decorates a Christmas tree, the song &apos;You Were Always
          on My Mind&apos; serves as a backdrop, emphasizing the subtle, often
          overlooked aspects of familial bonds. Despite their shortcomings in
          expressing love, the characters bid farewell with the realization that
          love has the potential to return unexpectedly, even if it arrives in
          the form of a questionable bottle in the wee hours of the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;All of Us Strangers&quot; masterfully weaves a narrative that
          transcends stereotypes, exploring the complexity of love, loss, and
          the enduring resilience of human connections. The film invites viewers
          to reflect on the profound nature of relationships and the
          transformative power of understanding and acceptance.

          Park Shin-hye as a great and amazing actor.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a decade-long career marked by critically acclaimed performances,
          Hyung-sik reveals his penchant for embracing diverse roles in genres
          ranging from romantic comedies like Strong Woman Do Bong Soon to
          apocalyptic dramas like Happiness. He considers himself a positive
          actor, driven by curiosity and a willingness to take on challenges.
          Notably, he expresses a preference for roles in shows with powerful
          women characters, emphasizing the importance of relating to and
          understanding his characters.

        <p>

          He shares his admiration for the film Oppenheimer and envisions
          playing a role with similar depth and intensity. Additionally, he
          reveals his fondness for Indian cinema, particularly praising Rajkumar
          Hirani&apos;s 3 Idiots, expressing a desire to try his luck in
          Bollywood.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of the Wooga Squad, a close-knit group of friends
          including BTS&apos; V, Park Seo Joon, Choi Wook Sik, and Peakboy,

          film&apos;s official title, Kubera, was also revealed on the same day.

          Named after the wealthiest Hindu god and the king of Yakshas, Kubera,
          the film appears to cast Dhanush in the titular role. Contrary to his
          character&apos;s namesake, the first look presents the actor in the
          guise of a beggar, suggesting irony as a central theme in the
          movie&apos;s nomenclature.

          Initially referred to as #DNS, representing Dhanush, Nagarjuna, and
          Sekhar Kammula, the project is produced by Suniel Narang and Puskur
          Ram Mohan Rao in collaboration with Amigos Creations Pvt Ltd. The film
          commenced with an elaborate pooja ceremony on January 18.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sekhar Kammula, renowned for delivering consecutive hits like Fidaa
          and Love Story, is poised to captivate audiences with his upcoming
          directorial venture, a Tamil-Telugu bilingual. With Dhanush aiming to
          establish a stronger presence in the Telugu market, following the
          lackluster performance of Vaathi as Sir, Kubera is anticipated to be a
          game-changer in that regard.

          Krushna Abhishek recently shared insights into his television journey,
          shedding light on his comedic exploits and the financial compensation
          he received. During an interview on Bharti Singh&apos;s podcast,
          Bharti TV, the actor disclosed that his association with Bollywood
          star Govinda, his uncle, often attracted casting interest.

        <p>
          Recounting his Comedy Circus stint, Krushna admitted, &quot;I signed
          up for Comedy Circus primarily for the monetary aspect, and I was
          content with it. They offered me ‚Çπ1.5 lakh per episode, showcasing
          considerable respect due to my connection with Govinda. The prospect
          of earning ‚Çπ3 lakh per day left me in awe.&quot;

          The conversation delved into Krushna&apos;s foray into Bhojpuri films,
          where he reminisced about earning ‚Çπ3 lakh per film during that period.
          He emphasized the intense shooting schedule, spanning 30 days of
          day-and-night shoots, reflecting on his pride in contributing to the
          Bhojpuri film industry. He shared an amusing anecdote about a film
          where he struggled to comprehend scenes, only to see it emerge as a
          box office hit.
